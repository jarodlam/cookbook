### Ingredients

* 2 tbl grated beeswax.  Grate it with a dollar store or old cheese grater. You will never be able to use it for anything else after you grate beeswax on it.
* 1 (2?) Tablespoon Coconut Oil {the kind you cook with}
* 2 teaspoons sweet almond oil
* A chunk of some red lipstick.  How much depends on your preference. Just keep in mind that it will look dark in the pot but won’t be that dark on. A lot of color goes a little way.
* 1/2 teaspoon of shimmery eye shadow  – to add some subtle sparkle.
* 10 drops essential oils - lemon or orange

### Method

* Boil water in a small sauce pan and rest a metal bowl on top – to make a double boiler. Or with a small metal bowl in a larger pan of boiling water to give it more of a “water bath.”
* Melt all the ingredients together until it liquefies and there are no more visible beeswax flakes. Then immediately remove it from the heat. You don’t want to overcook it or boil it. It will not last as long {get grainy and rancid} if you do.
* Use a bamboo skewer or other throw way tool, to stir it.
* Off heat, stir in 10 drops or so of essential oil. I used peppermint but lemon or orange would be so yummy for summer.
* You add the essential oil at this stage so that it doesn’t completely evaporate away during cooking.
* Then using a disposable medicine dropper fill your lip gloss containers. You can pour it instead, but this helps it look cleaner.
* Let it sit at room temperature or in the fridge {speeds things up} for a couple of hours so that it completely hardens and turns opaque.
* And now you have a soothing, smooth lip balm with just a hint of color and a hint of sun protection.
