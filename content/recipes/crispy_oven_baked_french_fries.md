### Ingredients

* 2 medium russet potatoes
* course salt
* 1 Tbl oil

### Method

* Start with a couple of medium russet potatoes. Preheat oven to 425 convection.
* Peal potatoes if desired. Cut your fries. I use a mandolin but a knife will do. Place in cold water and soak for 15 to 20 minutes.
* Rinse the fries with cold water and place on towel and dry reasonably well. *Dry the bowl and put fries back in and mix with about a tablespoon of oil.
* Prepare a baking sheet with aluminum foil and a rack. Spray with PAM.
* Spread the fries on a prepared rack. Give a light sprinkle of course salt.6) Bake until golden brown. About 30 minutes.

### Tips for Crispy French Fries

* You need to cook at a high temp. I ended up at 425 convection. I think convection is important if you are using the rack to not have to flip the fries.
* The potatoes must be soaked, rinsed and then dried or they will just be a mushy mess.
* A light coat of oil adds some taste.
* Put the salt on before you bake.
* If you put them up on a rack they will brown all around and you do not need to flip them half way through
* Never overlap fries. If they touch some, they will be ok since they will shrink a little and still brown.
