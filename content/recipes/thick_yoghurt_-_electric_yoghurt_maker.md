* 1/4 cup starter, full fat pot set yoghurt - yoghurt with live cultures in the ingredients list or 1 portion of dried yoghurt cultures (match head worth)
* 1 litre full uht/ longlife milk
* 2-3 tablespoons sugar, (optional, for a sweet vanilla version)
* 1-2 teaspoons vanilla, (optional, for a sweet vanilla version)

### Method

T\*ransfer to your electric yoghurt maker and incubate for 8-24 hours.

* Place container into the fridge overnight to chill & firm up more.

### Tips

* FULL FAT PRODUCTS. Make sure to use full fat products for the best results.TART YOGHURT. Can be one of two things. If you use a natural pot set yoghurt as the starter the tanginess will transfer. I prefer using a sweet greek or vanilla yoghurt. Also if you make a plain yoghurt (no sugar or vanilla) & culture for too long your yoghurt will be tart. The little bacteria in the yoghurt eat the milk sugars & turn them into lactic acid. FRIDGE LIFE. This yoghurt will easily last 2-3 weeks if no one double dips Wink Always judge by smell & taste.DONT FORGET! Once your yoghurt has set, place Â¼ cup into a clean container & store somewhere in the fridge where no one will eat it. This can be used to make your next batch!USING FRESH MILK. You MUST first cook your milk at 90* for atleast 10 minutes, then allow it to cool back to under 37* before using. This breaks down the proteins in the milk. This is why I use UHT as I can skip this process.USING AN EASIYO SACHET AS A STARTER. You may split the easiyo sachet into 4 portions & use 1 portion (1/4 packet) in place of the starter. Store the remaining 3 portions in your freezer. You can use this at a later date.
