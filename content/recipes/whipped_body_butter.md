### Ingredients for White Chocolate Body Butter

* 1/4 cup shea butter 
* 1/4 cup cocoa butter 
* 1/4 cup coconut oil 
* 1/4 cup sweet almond oil 
* 10-20 drops of essential oil  

### Ingredients for Regular Body Butter

* Note: This version does not smell like chocolate
* /2 cup shea butter 
* 1/4 cup coconut oil 
* 1/4 cup sweet almond oil 
* 10-20 drops of essential oil 

### Method

* Combine all ingredients, except the essential oils, in a small pot or double boiler.
* Gently melt and stir over medium-low heat until the mixture is liquid.
* Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to partially set up. I’m horribly impatient, so I put mine in the freezer to speed the process. (And then promptly forgot and left it in there way to long… *a-hem*).
* Once the mixture is partially set, add the essential oils of your choice, and whip with a hand mixer or stand mixer (my favorite stand mixer) until the body butter is fluffy and stiff peaks have formed.
* Spoon the finished body butter into a cute little jar. Apply as needed to dry skin anywhere on your body, or give it as a gift!

### Notes

* It’s really important to allow the body butter to set up, otherwise it won’t whip. I’ve found it’s ready to whip when I can stick my finger in the middle and it will hold the indentation. However, if you accidentally forget about your body butter in the fridge or freezer and it gets too hard, all is not lost. Simply allow it to thaw at room temperature until it reaches the proper consistency.
* You can easily store your whipped body butter at room temperature. However, if your house is very warm, it may melt. But if this happens, you can simply re-whip and you’ll be good to go.
* My favorite essential oil for this recipe is peppermint–especially peppermint combined with the white chocolate body butter recipe… YUM.
* Other good essential oil options would be lavender, bergamot, frankincense, geranium, or wild orange.
