### Ingredients

* 1 onion peeled and halved
* 20g ginger
* 15g garlic
* ½ red chilli (optional)
* 20g oil
* 60g brown sugar
* 60g rice wine vinegar
* 70g soy sauce
* 1 tsp salt
* 30g TMX stock
* 350g water
* 2 tbsp corn flour mixed in some water
* 6 chicken thighs trimmed and diced
* Vegetables for steaming (snow peas, carrot, broccoli, capsicum) 
* 350g packet noodles

### Method

* Add onion ginger, garlic and chilli (if using) to bowl and chop on Speed 6 for 3 seconds.  
* Add 20g oil and sauté for 7 minutes at Varoma Speed 2.
* Add sugar, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, salt, stock and water to the bowl then insert the basket into the bowl.  Add chicken into basket and place lid on bowl.  Cook for 10 minutes at Varoma Speed 3.
* Stir chicken in basket, place varoma on top of bowl with vegetables in tray and cook for 10 minutes at Varoma Speed 4.  
* Meanwhile prepare your noodles according to the packet.  I used chow mein noodles so I placed them in the Thermoserver and poured boiling water over the top.  I let them sit for 5 minutes with the lid on and then drained.
* Remove basket and Varoma, with blades on speed 2 add the corn flour mix then cook for a further 4 minutes at Varoma Speed 4 (to help reduce the sauce) with the basket on top.
* I added the noodles to the sauce and stirred for 30 seconds on Reverse Soft speed but alternatively you could pour the sauce over the noodles, then add the chicken.
