### Ingredients

* 440g plain spelt flour
* 4tsp baking powder
* 1/2tsp fine sea salt
* 60g olive oil
* 230g rice-almond milk or other milk substitute
* 1 tsp apple cider vinegar (optional)

### Method

* Preheat oven to 220Â°C. 
* Add 440g plain spelt flour (grind up to 200g of the flour from spelt grain first if you want wholemeal), 4tsp baking powder & 1/2 fine sea salt. Mix for 6secs, speed 6.
* Add 60g olive oil.  Mix for a few seconds on speed 5.
* Add 230g rice-almond milk or other milk substitute, 1 tsp apple cider vinegar (optional).  Mix for 5 seconds onb speed 5.
* Set dial to closed-lid position and mix for 20 seconds on interval speed. Dough should be soft and slightly sticky - adjust flour and milk if needed.
* Turn out onto lightly floured bread mat and pat into 3cm thick round. Cut scones out with the MC (cap in the top of the Thermomix lid), dipping it into flour after each one. Place onto floured/greased tray so that scones are touching each other. Cook in hot oven for about 15 mins, or until scones are lightly browned, and cooked through (pull centre ones apart to check).
