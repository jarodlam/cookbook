### Ingredients

* 1 cucumber 
* 1/2 lemon, peeled
* 1 cup Purslane
* 1/2 mango, peeled and pit removed
* Handful of cilantro

### Method

* Blend in the Thermomix on speed 10 for 1.5 minutes.

### Notes

Purslane is a green weed high in essential omega-3 acids. The body does
not produce omega-3s on its own and needs to get them through food.
Omega-3s help lower inflammation. With skin issues such as acne and
eczema, it is important to get enough of this anti-inflammatory acid.
