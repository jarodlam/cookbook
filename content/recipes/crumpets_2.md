### Ingredients

* 5 grams Yeast
* 1 cup Flour
* 1 tsp Salt
* 2 tbsp Butter
* 2 cups Water warm

### Method

* In a bowl or jug, mix the yeast with a few tablespoons of the warm water, stir until the yeast is dissolved and leave for about five minutes.
* In a separate bowl, add the salt and sift in the flour.  Whisk  about 2/3 of the remaining water into the flour, then add the yeast mixture.
* Cover and leave in a warm place until the mixture doubles (about an hour).  The mixture should be quite thick but pour quite easily.  Add more water if you think it is required.
* Heat a frypan pan gently and spray with canola oil.
* Using egg rings - grease each lightly with canola spray - put the rings into the pan and pour in enough batter to fill each ring about 1/2 full.
* Cook on a low heat for about 4 minutes or until small holes appear and the tops of the crumpets appears to be 'pasty'.
* Take off the rings and flip the crumpet to brown on the top (about one minute).
* Butter lightly and serve - lovely with Golden Syrup or Jam. Makes about 6 crumpets.

### Notes

* Homemade Crumpets are best eaten fresh and hot.  Not suitable for freezing.
