### Ingredients for TangZhong

* 50g bread flour
* 125g milk
* 125g water

### Method for TangZhong

* Place all ingredients in the Thermomix and cook at 70°C, speed 2, 10-15 minutes until the mixture becomes a paste. Temperature for the paste should be about 65°C when it is done.
* Cover the surface with cling wrap (the cling wrap should touch the surface) and store in the fridge. I used mine immediately after it had cooled to room temperature. 

### Ingredients for Bread

* 350gm bread flour 
* 55gm caster sugar 
* 2gm salt 
* 56gm egg (I beat 2 small eggs and poured out what I needed. Keep the rest for glazing.) 
* 7gm non-dairy creamer powder 
* 125g milk 
* 120gm tangzhong 
* 6gm instant yeast 
* 30gm salted butter

### Method for Bread

* Place milk, egg, tangzhong, sugar, salt and milk powder at the bottom of TM bowl. Add the flour on top of the liquids, then the yeast on top of the flour. 
* Press the turbo 2-3 times to mix the ingredients together.
* Knead for 10 minutes on the knead setting. 
* Add the butter and knead another 5-10 minutes on the knead setting until the dough is elastic.
* Shape into a ball and place into a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel and allow to proof for about 30 minutes until doubled in size.
* Once risen, turn the dough out on to a lightly greased silicone mat and punch down to release the air. Proceed to shape the dough into rolls. I did some plain and some with sambal prawn filling.
* Set the shaped dough aside for another 40 minutes to rise. 
* Before baking, glaze with the leftover egg or milk.
* Bake at 180°C for 20 minutes (I baked rolls, if you do a loaf baking time will be longer.
