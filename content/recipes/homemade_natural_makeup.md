### Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons zinc oxide (Can use arrowroot powder instead if desired, but it will not offer quite as much coverage)
* 1 tablespoon arrowroot powder (optional)
* 1 teaspoon gold mica dust
* Â½ - 1 tsp of desired natural clay powder (optional) I used a pinch of White cosmetic clay, Fuller's Earth Clay and french green clay
* up to 1 teaspoon finely ground cocoa powder OR bonze mica powder (or both) to get desired color
* Optional: 1 teaspoon of translucent mica powder can help for really oily skin

### Method

* Mix all ingredients to get desired color and coverage.

Zinc oxide will give coverage and matte finish. Colored mica powders,
natural clays and cocoa powder will give color. Start slowly and add as
needed, testing on inner-arm as you go to find your shade. Store in a
small glass jar with a lid.

### Notes

* If you prefer, just arrowroot powder (or white cosmetic clay), cocoa powder, and (optional) cinnamon powder can be used. This will create a great and completely natural/edible foundation but it will not stay as long as a powder containing zinc oxide and mica. I personally feel safe using zinc oxide on my skin (non nano and uncoated) but if you don't, just stick to the arrowroot version.
