### Ingredients

* 500 grams beef (I use poterhouse) trimmed

### Ingredients - Marinade

* 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons fish sauce
* 1 chilli
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 bunch coriander (about 4 pieces)
* 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
* 1-2 teaspoons fresh ground black pepper
* 40 grams ginger
* Juice of 1 lime
* 1 teaspoon palm sugar (I use one small block of Jeeny's brand).

### Stirfry option

* 1 thin rice noodles
* 4 pieces chinese greens
* Half of leek
* Half of red capsicum
* 4 pieces spring onion in 5 cm lengths
* 50 toasted chopped peanuts

### Method

* Add all marinade ingredients to the TM bowl and blitz until mixed. 
* Trim beef and prepare into large chunks about the size of a muesli bar. Pour marinade and beef into a non-reactive container and marinate for at lease half an hour, or longer. 
* Meanwhile slice all ingredients for the stirfry, except nuts. 
* Soak noodles in boiling water until soft. Remove noodles when done and rinse under cold water to prevent further cooking. 
* Heat some peanut oil in a frypan until hot. Take half the meat out of the marinade, dripping off the excess marinade. Sear each side of the beef pieces and set aside, lightly covered, when done. Repeat for the rest of the beef. You may need to clean the pan in between batches as the sugars may have burnt on the bottom. Rest the beef, covered. Place the marinade in a separate pan WITH ONE CUP OF WATER and boil gently.
* Heat up some peanut oil in a wok. Put the stirfry ingredients in. Meanwhile toast the crushed peanuts in a separate frypan. add a little bit of the marinade to the stirfy. Add the noodles and toss. Turn off the heat.
* Slice the beef into strips and add at the last moment. Mix in.
* Serve with the peanuts on top, and maybe some coriander leaves.  Serve the warmed marinade sauce on the side in a little bowl.

### Tip

* The sliced beef is also nice over an Asian salad too.
