## Ingredients

* 1 can of 560ml Coconut Cream
* 1 can of 560ml Coconut Milk

* 120g Natural Yoghurt culture

## Method

* In Thermomix, blend coconut cream and potato starch for 10sec, sp4.  Heat to 80deg,10mins, sp3.
* Note: The longer you heat it the thicker the consistency – it doesn’t thicken much more on sitting so you need to get it where you want it in thickness during the cooking process)
* Leave in Thermomix till it cools to 37 degrees. This may take approx. 50mins. 
* Once coconut milk mixture has cooled to 37 degrees, add natural yoghurt culture, mix 4secs,sp4, then heat 10mins,37deg,sp3.
* While the yoghurt is heating, fill ThermoServer with hot boiling water and place lid on it to sterilise and warm it.
* Empty the water from ThermoServer and pour in the yoghurt mixture and cover with lid.  Wrap some tea towels around the ThermoServer and leave undisturbed for 8-10 hours. Then pour into containers and refrigerate.

### Below is the original recipe from the website

## Ingredients

* 2 cans Organic Coconut Cream (800 grams total)
* 200 grams water
* OR  if you are feeling the love, make your own coconut milk to equal about 1 litre (see below)
* 1 tsp yoghurt starter powder (buy at health food store) OR ¼ cup store bought non-dairy yoghurt such as CoYo
* 60 grams  tapioca flour (arrowroot) (You can add more if you want a thicker consistency)
* 1 Tblsp Xylitol (for bacterial culture to feed on) you can use whatever sweetener you prefer

## Method

* Sterilise your mixing spoons and other utensils with boiling water before beginning.
* Sit at room temperature your yoghurt starter or store-bought yoghurt.
* In the Thermomix, blend coconut milk, & arrowroot for 10 secs on Speed 4. Heat to 80 degrees. About 10 mins, Speed 3.
* The longer you heat it the thicker the consistency – it doesn’t thicken much more on sitting so you need to get it where you want it in thickness during the cooking process)
* Leave in Thermomix till it cools to 37 degrees. This may take 1.5 to 2 hours.
* Once coconut milk has cooled to 37 degrees, add Xylitol. Mix in well, Speed 3 for 10 seconds.
* Pour about ½ cup of cooled coconut milk into small jug (sterilised) containing your yoghurt starter or store bought yoghurt. Stir well.
* Pour the inoculated batch back into the Thermomix containing the remainder of the cooled coconut milk.
* Blend gently on Speed 3 for 4 secs.
* Cook for about 3 mins on Speed 1, 37 degrees. To bring to even temperature.
* While the yoghurt is heating fill your container (I use my Thermoserver, but you can use a large thermos or yoghurt maker) with hot boiling water and place lid on it to sterilise and warm it.
* Empty the water from the food Thermos and pour the yoghurt in.
* Once sealed, wrap some tea towels around the food thermos and leave undisturbed for 8-10 hours. Then pour into containers and refrigerate.
* You can serve with a coulis of the fruit of your choice or just on it’s own YUM!!

## Tips

* To make coconut milk using the Thermomix. Soak 2 cups of dessicated coconut in 4 cups of water for 2 hours. Then in Thermomix, make sure it heats to 100 degrees, Speed 4 – about 5 mins or so. Then mix for 20 secs on Speed 8. Strain through stainless steel funnel or cheese cloth to create coconut milk. 

## Modification

* Use 3x270g cans Ayam coconut cream
* Use 70g arrowroot starch instead of 60g
* Use 40g raw honey instead of zylitol
* Use 1/4 cup coyo as starter
* Follow the instruction, except in the first part of cooking, cook for 15mins, instead of 10mins.
