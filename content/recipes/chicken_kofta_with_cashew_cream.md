### Ingredients for Kofta

* 1 clove garlic 
* Pinch of saffron threads 
* 1 leek 
* a good sprinkle of chives 
* Small handful parsley 
* 6-8 brussel sprouts 
* 1 teaspoon salt 
* 200g bread crumbs 
* 800g chicken mince 

### Ingredients for Cashew Cream

* 300g of cashews 
* 300g water 
* 1 clove garlic 
* 1 teaspoon citric acid 
* 1 teaspoon of salt

### Method for Kofta

* Add garlic, saffron, leek, chives, parsley and brussel sprouts to TM bowl. Chop for 5 sec on speed 7. Add salt, bread crumbs and mince.
* Mix on speed 6 for 10 sec to combine, stir with the spatula and continue mixing for another 10 sec or until combined well.
* Shape the chicken mixture into a sausage about 3cm in diameter and 10 cm long. (I made a few smaller ones for the littlest ones in the family). 
* Insert skewer straight through the length of the sausage. Lay them on a tray lined with baking paper, cover with glad wrap and place in the fridge for at least 1 hr. 

### Method for Cashew Cream

* Place all ingredients in the Thermomix bowl. Mix on speed 9 for 30 sec.
* Scrape down bowl, then cook on 90Â° for 4 minutes speed 3.
* Mix again for 40 sec on speed 9.

* Spray Koftas with spray oil and cook on a medium heat in frying pan. Turning every minute until cooked right the way around. May take approx 10 mins all up.
* Serve Koftas with the cashew cream.

### Tips

* I made my own bread crumbs before starting using 4-5 slices of bread on speed 6 for 5 seconds. Then put aside until ready to use. You could use rice crumbs or any that your family can tolerate.
