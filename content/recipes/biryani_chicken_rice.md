### Ingredients

* 4-8 Chicken thighs trimmed and quartered
* 5g fresh ginger
* 1 garlic clove
* Juice of 1 lime
* 2 coriander roots
* 150g plain yoghurt
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* ½ tsp cayenne pepper (less or more – to your preference)
* 40g tomato paste
* Salt and pepper

### Method

* Place everything except the chicken in the bowl and blitz on Speed 9 for 10 seconds.
* Pour over chicken and allow to marinade for 2 + hours.
* Clean the bowl.

### Ingredients for rice

* 150g brown onion peeled and halved
* 20g fresh ginger
* 2 garlic cloves
* 2-3 chillies
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 1 tbsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 40g olive oil
* 400g tin tomatoes
* 800g water
* 500g long rice
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 3 black cardamom pods
* 2 whole cloves
* Fresh coriander leaves, roasted cashews and black cumin for garnish

### Method for Rice

* Add onion, garlic, ginger and chillies to the bowl and chop on Speed 6 for 2 seconds.  Add oil, turmeric, coriander, cumin and garam masala and cook for 5 minutes at Varoma Reverse Speed 1.
* Meanwhile, put a bit of oil in a pan and heat up the cloves, cinnamon, cardamom and bay leaves until just fragrant.  Turn heat off.
* Set your TM5 to Automated Cooking for Boiled Rice.  When asked to add water add 800g (NOT 1000g) and a tin of tomatoes.  Follow the instructions of your machine to add the salt and rice.  Add bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon and cloves after you have added the rice.  Then turn the dial to cook on auto mode.  I put a simmering basket on top to avoid splatter.
* Meanwhile heat your oven to 200deg and place your chicken on a lined baking tray and cook for approximately 20 minutes.
* Place into a Thermoserver or platter as soon as it is ready and top with cashews, coriander and cumin seeds.  Serve the chicken either through the rice or on the side.
