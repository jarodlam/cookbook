* 30g sugar
* 1 tbspn TM stock concentrate
* Salt and Pepper
* A few basil leaves

### Method

* Add onion, garlic, and carrot to TM bowl. Chop 10 sec on speed 5. Add oil to bowl and sauté for 7 min, varoma temp, speed3/4.
* Scrape sides of bowl. Chop further 10 sec on speed 5.
* Add tomatoes and rest of ingredients and cook for 30 minutes on Varoma temp at speed 1. Place steamer basket on top instead of MC so that some of the liquid evaporates.
* Should you wish to make it more concentrated, cook for a further 5 or 10 minutes.

* NOTE: If using fresh tomatoes, make sure they are very ripe and red. Hull out the top and squeeze juice out with your hands. Then puree them on speed 6 or 7 until smooth. Remove and reserve for later use.

* This sauce can be used on its own or you can add grilled crispy bacon and mushrooms or sautés some peeled prawns, calamari and steamed mussels to it and simmer for 5-7 minutes and you have a delicious marina sauce.
