### Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons extra-light olive oil
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1 tablespoon wholegrain mustard
* 1 orange, juiced
* 12 chicken drumsticks
* 450g orange sweet potato, peeled, cut into 2cm pieces
* 450g desiree potatoes, peeled, cut into 2cm pieces
* 100g baby spinach leaves

### Method

* Preheat oven to 240Â°C. Combine 1 tablespoon of oil, honey, mustard and 2 to 3 tablespoons of orange juice in a large baking dish. Add chicken and turn to coat.
* Combine remaining oil, sweet potatoes and potatoes in a large, non-stick roasting pan. Season with salt and pepper. Toss until well combined.
* Place potatoes on top shelf of oven. Roast, turning occasionally, for 20 minutes. Place chicken on lower shelf of oven. Roast, basting occasionally, for 20 minutes.
* Swap pans around in oven. Roast potatoes and chicken for a further 20 minutes or until potatoes are golden and tender and chicken is cooked through.
* Reserve 4 drumsticks (see tip - Creamy Chicken Pasta Bake) for related recipe. Divide the potatoes and spinach between serving plates. Top each with 2 of the remaining drumsticks. Serve.
