### Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon coconut oil
* 1 teaspoon pure almond oil
* 1 teaspoon cocoa butter
* 3-4 drops pure vitamin E oil
* 1-2 drops pure peppermint extract
* 3-4 semisweet chocolate chips

### Method

* Place all ingredients in a small heat-safe bowl (glass or metal is good) and set aside.
* Place a small saucepan with about 1 inch of water in it over medium-low heat, and heat until the water is steaming and simmering.
* Set the bowl on top of the steaming pot of water, taking care that the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water.
* Using a small spoon or spatula, slowly melt the ingredients until they are melted and thoroughly combined. This should take about 5 minutes.
* When the ingredients are combined and the mixture is smooth, pour the lip gloss into a sterilized small container and allow to cool to room temperature until solid, about 1 hour.
* Store the lip gloss in your purse or in the fridge, but be cautious that it will melt under hot temperatures! Apply with your finger or a small brush.
* The lip gloss should keep for up to two months.
