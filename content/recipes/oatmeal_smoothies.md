### Ingredients

* 1 cup ice
* 1/2 cup frozen raspberries
* 1/2 cup plain low fat yogurt
* 1 banana
* 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1 cup coconut water (or other liquid, such as juice)

### Method

* Blend in the Thermomix on speed 10 for 2 minutes. (Note: I find 1.5mins is enough)
* Check texture – if it’s too thick, add some more water and re-blend briefly.
