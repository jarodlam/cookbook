### Ingredients

* 1 organic chicken, chopped into pieces
* 40 cloves of garlic, unpeeled
* 1/2 cup white wine or Verjuice or apple juice or chicken stock (I usually use a mixture of apple juice and chicken stock)
* 3 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)
* fresh sage, chopped finely (or 1/2 teaspoon dried sage)
* fresh parsley, chopped finely
* 4 small bay leaves
* 1 teaspoon herb salt & some freshly ground pepper (may need more salt if using apple juice)

### Method

* Scatter 40 garlic cloves over the bottom of a casserole dish. You can use a flat dish if you want more crispy skin, or a deep dish if you want softer, juicier chicken.
* Place chicken pieces over the garlic, skin side up.
* Sprinkle the chicken with wine, juice or stock, oil, seasonings and herbs. 
* Cover the dish tightly with foil (and a lid if it has one) so no steam can escape. Bake at 180 degrees C for 1 1/2 hours. Remove lid and foil, and return to the oven to brown for another 15 minutes. Discard bay leaves.
* Serve with mashed potato.
