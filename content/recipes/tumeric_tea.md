### Ingredients

* 1/3 cup or 80ml good raw honey
* 1 1/2 tsp dried tumeric
* Lemon
* lots of freshly ground black pepper

### Method

* Work the turmeric into the honey until it forms a paste. You can keep this on hand, in a jar, for whenever you'd like a cup.
* For each cup of tea, place a heaping teaspoon of the turmeric paste in the bottom of a mug. Pour hot (but not boiling water) into the mug, and stir well to dissolve the turmeric paste. 
* Add a big squeeze of juice from a lemon and a good amount of black pepper.  Enjoy!
