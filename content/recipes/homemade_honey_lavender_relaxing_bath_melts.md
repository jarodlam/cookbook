### Ingredients

* 50 grams Shea Butter
* 50 grams Cocoa Butter
* 1/4 teaspoon Yogi brand Honey Lavendar Stress Relief Herbal Organic Tea
* 1 teaspoon lavender flowers (you can also find this at your local craft store possibly.. or dry your own to use)
* 30 drops Lavender essential oil
* Silicone heart mold

### Method

* To make these just weigh out the 50 grams of the shea butter and cocoa butter on a scale. If you donâ€™t have a scale you can measure out around 1/4 cup of each instead. Using a double boiler or your microwave, melt the butters together until melted.  Break open a tea bag and measure out 1/4 teaspoon of the herbs inside. Add the tea and lavender to the melted shea/cocoa butter mixture. Stir to combine.
* Put your silicone mold on a cookie sheet. Take your essential oils and drop 2 drops into each heart in the mold. Then pour your melted mixture into the mold.
* Allow to cool (I stuck mine into the freezer for 20 minutes) and then pop your melts right out of the silicone tray. Makes 15 melts in this batch. That is 15 gloriously relaxing bath nights.
