### Ingredients

* 300g Roma tomatoes, cubed
* 90g Parmesan, cubed
* 80g toasted walnuts
* 5g Dulse sea vegetable, flakes (available online here; http://www.seaveg.co.uk/dulse.html)
* 5g good Balsamic vinegar
* 2-3 anchovy fillets

### Method

* Place tomatoes into Thermomix bowl and cook for 10 min/100°C/Reverse + speed 1.

* Place Parmesan and walnuts into clean, dry Thermomix bowl and mill for 8 sec/speed 9.
* Add all remaining ingredients and blend for 30 sec/speed 4, scraping down as necessary.

### Taste

* Serve on crostini, as is.
* Add to a cheese platter as a spread.
* Stir through hot soups, bolognaise sauce, curries, and any other savoury dishes as needed.
* Blend 1-2 tbsp Umami paste through freshly made butter with some flat leaf parsley and lemon juice for a delicious U-Butter to top a grilled steak, fish, or as an alternative to garlic or herb butter.
* Add to risotto or stir through hot cooked pasta with chopped herbs and EVOO for a quick and easy meal.
* Rub onto uncooked chicken breast, wrap breast in sliced mozzarella and bacon and cook on hot grill.
* Dehydrate tomato solids in warm oven on piece of baking paper for as long as it takes for it to become brittle. Mill and add to powdered stock…recipe to come!

### What is Umami Paste

* It is the fifth flavour and it is amazing how much depth it adds to savory dishes. Try it in anything that is a sauce, soup, braise, curry, you name it, umami it! It is fantatic whipped into fresh butter with parsley and lemon juice, rolled, sliced and plopped on top of cooked fish or steak…you will never look back. SO let your imagination run wild, and get addicted.  It is the addictive flavour in all the bad foods you can’t just eat one of. (Think Pringles for example!)
