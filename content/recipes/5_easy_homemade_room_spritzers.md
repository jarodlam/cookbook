### Notes

* These recipes are for small batches. Feel free to double or triple if you find a mix you really like!
* You can use whatever type of water you have available- I just use our plain tap water.
* Not only does the addition of the vanilla extract in some of these recipes make the blend smell fabulous, but the alcohol in the extract actually helps the mixture to not clog up the spray nozzle. (Just make sure you are using the real stuff– the fake “vanilla” isn’t the same.
* Because some essential oils have the tendency to break down plastic, if I am going to consume a blend, I always, always keep it in a glass container. However, since I won’t be drinking any of these mixes, I don’t have a problem sticking them in a plastic spray bottle if I’m running low on my glass spritzers. 
* Give your spritzers a good shake before you spray to make sure the oils are mixed into the water.
