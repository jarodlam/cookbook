-   Preheat the oven to 150 deg C. Place the sugar and water in a
    saucepan over low heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Brush
    the sides of the pan with a little water to remove any sugar
    crystals. Increase the heat and boil for 8-10 mins or until golden
    colour. Pour into 4 x 3/4 cup capacity ramekins. Set aside for 5
    mins to allow the caramel to set.
-   To make the custard, place the milk and cream in a saucepan over low
    heat and heat until warm. Place the eggs, extra egg yolks, sugar and
    vanilla in a bowl and whisk until well combined. Slowly pour over
    the milk mixture while whisking well to combine. Strain and pour
    over the caramel in the ramekins.
-   Place the ramekins in a baking tray and pour in enough hot water to
    come three-quarters of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake
    for 35 mins or until the custard is set. Remove from the tray and
    refrigerate until cold.
-   To serve, dip the base of each ramekin into hot water for 10
    seconds, invert the creme caramel onto a plate and serve
    immediately.
