### Ingredients

* 1 mango, peeled and pitted
* 1 cup frozen blueberries
* 3 cups baby spinach
* 1/4 cup cacao nibs (or 2 tablespoons cacao powder)
* 8 ounces of filtered almond milk
* sweetener (optional)

### Method

* Blend all ingredients in a blender until smooth.

### Notes

* Young coconuts contain up to 16 ounces of coconut water. I recommend that you make this smoothie with 8 ounces of coconut water and drink the rest while you blend. Adding more than 8 ounces of coconut water will make the the smoothie thinner.
