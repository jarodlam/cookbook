### Ingredients

* 250g Copha (Vegetable Shortening) make sure you copha is a room temperature.
* 1 1/2 Cups (300g) Sugar
* 2 Eggs
* 2 3/4 Cups(470g) Plain Flour
* 2 Teaspoons Cream of Tartar
* 1 Teaspoon Bicarbonate of Soda
* pinch of salt
* Cinnamon sugar (2 Teaspoons Cinnamon, 1/4 cup castor sugar)

### Non-Thermomix Method

* Preheat oven to 180ºC and line large baking trays with baking paper.
* Beat copha and sugar together until mixed well and you can’t feel the sugar between your fingers.
* Add eggs one at a time until well combined.
* Sift together all of the dry ingredients and add to ingredients. Mix until well combined.
* It makes it much better for cooking if you measure each biscuit and use a tablespoon to get close to the same as then the biscuits cook at the same time.
* Roll into Tablespoon size balls then roll into cinnamon sugar until ball are completely covered.
* Place rolled cinnamon sugar covered balls on to baking trays (a good distance apart, as the biscuits spread) and bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes.

### Thermomix Method

* Preheat oven to 180ºC and line a large baking tray with baking paper.
* Beat room temperature copha and sugar together, 30 seconds/speed 5, scrape down the bowl and continue mixing 2 minutes/speed 5.
* Add eggs and mix 20 seconds/speed 5, scrape down the bowl and mix another 1 minute/speed 5.
* Add all other ingredients (except cinnamon sugar) and mix 30 seconds/speed 5, using the spatula to make sure all the ingredients is combined well.
* Roll into Tablespoon size balls then roll into cinnamon sugar. I normally put all the ingredients into another bowl to make it easier to get out the tablespoons, but you can do it straight from the mixing bowl if you like.
* Place rolled cinnamon sugar covered balls on to baking trays (a good distance apart, as the biscuits spread) and bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes.
