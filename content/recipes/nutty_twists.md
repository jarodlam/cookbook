### Ingredients

* 2 packagespuff pastry (275g each), rolled into rectangles (25x42cm), refrigerated
* 200g hazelnuts, with skin, whole
* 60g sugar
* 1tbl vanilla sugar, homemade (see below)
* 1tsp cinnamon, ground
* 100g cream (20-30% fat)
* 10g icing sugar

### Method

* Preheat oven to 210 deg C.
* Roll out both sheets of pastry and place them side by side.
* Place hazelnuts, sugar, vanilla sugar and cinnamon into mixing bowl and grind for 10sec/speed 7.  Scrape sides of the mixing bowl with spatula.
* Add cream, mix it for 15sec/speed 4 and spread evenly over one of the two sheets of pastry with a tablespoon.
* Place the second sheet of pastry directly on top of the one with the nut mixture, aligning the edges. and press down gently.
* Using a pastry wheel or a sharp knife, cut out long narrow strips about 3cm wide, beginning from one narrow side to another, and then cut these long strips in thirds to make 24 strips (about 3x14cm).
* Twist each strip twice "on itself", as though twisting a cord, to form a bow.  Place them on two baking trays lined with baking paper and bake one tray at a time for 15mins or until golden.
* Allow twists to cool before dusting with icing sugar.

### Variations

* Almond Twists - Replace hazelnuts with almonds.
* Poppy seed twists - Replace nuts with poppy seeds, ground together with the sugar and vanilla sugar (omit cinnamon) for 30sec/speed 9.
* Peanut twists - Replace hazelnuts with roasted, slated peanuts, reducing the sugar to 30g, the cream to 50g and omitting the cinnamon.

### Vanilla Sugar

* 1 vanilla pod and 150g sugar
* Split vanilla pod in 2 and again in 2 lengthwise.  Place both sugar and vanilla pod into mixing bowl and pulverise 1min/speed 9.
* Store vanilla sugar in an airtight container.
