### Ingredients - Dough

* 30 g fresh yeast or 2tsp dry/instant yeast
* 620 g bakers flour
* 50 g sugar
* 380 g milk
* 1.5 tsp salt
* 1-2 tsp cinnamon
* 1-2 tsp mixed spice
* 60 g Butter
* 1 egg
* 180 g sultanas/currents/cranberries etc

### Ingredients - Paste for Crosses

* 90 g bakers or plain flour
* 100 g water
* 1 pinch salt
* 1 tbsp olive oil

### Ingredients - Glaze

* 2 tbsp water
* 2 tbsp sugar

### Method - Dough

* If you're using fresh yeast: In a small bowl cream yeast with 1tsp flour & 1tsp sugar and leave until it bubbles (5-10mins).  If you're using instant yeast then skip this step.
* Measure flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, mixed spice and butter into TM Bowl and mix 5sec/sp8. Set aside. 
* Add milk to TM bowl and heat 2.5min/37deg/sp1 or until temperature is reached. 
* As long as yeast mixture has bubbled from step 1 add it into the TM bowl with the milk. Mix 5sec/sp2-3. Leave it to sit in the bowl for 10-15mins until it becomes frothy.
* If you're using instant yeast add, along with 1tsp of sugar, to the TM Bowl with the warmed milk. Mix 5sec/sp2-3. Leave it to sit in the bowl for 10-15mins until it becomes frothy.
* Add flour mix that you set aside and the egg to the TM bowl and mix 10-15sec/sp7 or until all ingredients are combined. 
* With MC on weigh sultana's (or whichever dried fruit you're using) onto lid. 
* Knead 3mins/Closed lid/dough mode. When there is about 1min to go remove MC so sultana's can fall into bowl. Help this process if necessary. 
* Set dough mix aside in a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a clean cloth and stand in a warm place until dough doubles in size. Depending on the weather this can take from 40-60mins. I put my oven on 35deg and place the bowl in there if it is not a warm day. 
* Preheat oven to 200degC.
* Punch down dough and then knead well. You can either put it back in your TM bowl and knead 3mins/Closed lid/dough mode or knead well by hand for about 4mins.
* Divide dough into 16-20 even sized portions. Form into balls and place them close together on a greased baking dish. 
* Stand in a warm place to prove for 20-30mins or until buns are 1.5 times their original size. 

### Method - Paste for Glaze

* Place all paste ingredients into clean TM bowl and mix 30sec/sp4.
* Pour into piping bag and pipe crosses onto buns. 
* Bake for about 20mins or until golden brown.

### Method - Glaze

* If you like your HCB's glazed then place water and sugar into TM Bowl and cook 2mins/100deg/sp4.
* Brush buns with hot sugar syrup while still warm.
