### Ingredients

* 250g plain biscuits (I used Marie)
* 125g of softened butter
* 370g cream cheese (room temp â€“ this is very important!)
* 400g condensed milk
* 250g thickened cream
* 75g of lime juice
* zest of lime

### Method

* Put peel of lime in TM to zest 5 sec / speed 9. Or if you have a microplane this will make the zest more fine which I prefer.
* Put biscuits in TM bowl and crush 10 sec / speed 10
* Add softened butter and mix 10 sec / speed 10. Scrape down and repeat 10 sec / speed 10.
* Press biscuit mix firmly into lined spring form tin. Place in tin in fridge while preparing the cheesecake mixture.
* Mix cream cheese 10 sec / speed 8. Scrape down and repeat 10 sec / speed 8.
* Add condensed milk and cream and mix 10 sec / speed 7. Scrape down and repeat 10 sec / speed 7.
* Add juice and mix 15 sec / speed 4. (NB: the juice needs to be added last. The reaction of the citrus juice will start to set your mixture almost immediately).
* Using spatula scrape down and ensure all is mixed well.
* Immediately pour mixture on top of biscuit base, sprinkle zest on top and refrigerate for at least a few hours.
* Best served straight from the fridge.

### Notes

* Lemon can be substituted for the lime.
* Do not try and use orange - it doesn't work! Trust me! :(
