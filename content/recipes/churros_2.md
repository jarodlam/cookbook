### Ingredients

* 1 cup of water
* 100g butter
* 1 cup flour (I ended up adding more as the dough was too wet)
* 2 eggs

### Method

* Heat water in a pan and add butter
* Remove from heat and add flour, mix till dough separates from edges. 
* Cool, add eggs. 
* Pipe into hot oil then roll in castor sugar and cinnamon. 
* We dip them in melted chocolate too!
