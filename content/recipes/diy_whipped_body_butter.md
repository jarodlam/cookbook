### Ingredients

* 1/2 cup of cocoa butter OR shea butter 
* 1/4 cup of coconut oil
* 1/4 cup of jojoba oil 
* 20-40 drops of your favourite essential oils

### Method

* Fill a small saucepan 1/4-1/2 way with water and heat over medium low. Shave off the required amount of cocoa butter using a spoon (it should crumble with gentle pressure) and measure into a glass measuring cup or large ceramic mug along with the coconut oil. 
* Place the cup or mug in the water (creating a makeshift double boiler) to gently melt the cocoa butter and coconut oil. Once all solids have dissolved (do not let it come to a boil), remove the container from the water and let it cool for 10-15 minutes. 
* Test the mixture with your finger. Once it's barely lukewarm (it may take another 10 minutes of cooling), stir in the jojoba oil and desired amount of essential oils. Start with a smaller amount, smell it, then add more. Let your nose be the guide. 
* Pour the mixture into a stainless steel mixing bowl (your stand mixer should come with one) and place in the freezer for 15-20 minutes. You want the body butter to begin solidifying, but not completely. It must be cold in order to whip properly. If you're using some other type of bowl or your freezer isn't as cold, it may need to hang out in there longer. 
* When it has solidified partly, remove from the freezer and whip on medium to medium-high power in your stand mixer with a wire whisk until it is the consistency of butter. You will need to take a break every few minutes to scrape down the sides. I think mine took about 4-5 minutes to do this. 
* Transfer to a container (like a glass mason jar) and store in the fridge until it has firmed up. If it's wintertime, or cold in your region, you can store it on the counter. 

### Notes

* As long as it doesn't come in contact with water, it should last three to six months; however if it starts to smell funky or look weird--toss it! You can always make more. :)
* If your home is especially warm (or it's summertime), you will need to put the body butter in the fridge immediately to keep it from melting. 
* If the body butter melts, don't fret! Simply stick it back in the fridge or freezer until it starts to solidify again and re-whip.  
* This recipe recommends a bit more essential oil than my normal DIY projects because cocoa butter has an strong, prominent scent (like chocolate). In order to smell the essential oils, you'll need more than usual. If you use shea butter instead, you may be able to use less. 
* Coconut oil turns into liquid at 76 degrees or higher, so if you change the ratio in this recipe to incorporate more coconut oil, you'll likely have to keep it in the fridge during warmer months.
* If you want to make a larger batch to give out as gifts, feel free to double this recipe; however, keep in mind that a little body butter goes a long way so your friends and family won't need much! 
* To make it look pretty when you're portioning it into containers, squeeze it through a piping bag or a plastic freezer bag with the corner cut off.
