    SET ASIDE in a jug.

### Ingredients

-   6-8 chicken thighs
-   1-2 eggs or buttermilk

### Method

-   (note when I tried to use buttermilk left from butter making I found
    it not to be thick enough so added 1 egg). Store bought buttermilk
    would be thicker.
-   Trim and halve your chicken thighs. In a separate bowl whisk eggs or
    alternatively pour some buttermilk in bowl. In a large fry pan, add
    enough oil for frying and turn onto a medium high heat.
-   Coat chicken in flour mix, then in egg wash and back into the flour.
    The double coat of flour helps to keep the coating on.
-   Fry until chicken is cooked. To serve you can pour sauce over the
    top or to keep chicken crunchy keep it in a pouring jug or a bowl
    for dipping.
