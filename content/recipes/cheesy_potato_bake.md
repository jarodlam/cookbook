### Ingredients

* 60g butter
* 1/4 cup plain flour
* 2 1/3 cups milk
* 2 cups grated tasty cheese
* 1.2kg Sebago potatoes, peeled, thinly sliced

### Method

* Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Grease a 6cm deep, 24cm square baking dish.
* Melt butter in a heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add flour. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes, or until bubbly. Remove from heat. Slowly add milk, stirring constantly until well combined. Return to heat. Cook, stirring, until sauce comes to the boil.
* Add 1 1/2 cups of cheese. Stir to combine.
* Arrange one-third of potatoes, overlapping slightly, over base of baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spoon one-third of the cheese sauce over potatoes. Repeat twice. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake for 1 hour, or until potatoes are tender and top is golden. If top begins to brown too much, cover with foil.
