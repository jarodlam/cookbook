### Notes

* You can make gummy bears in almost any flavor, using different combinations of freshly squeezed juices or pureed fruits. NOTE: Do not use pineapple – it contains enzymes that break down gelatin so it will not set properly. 

### Orange Gummy Bears Ingredients

* 1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons honey (use a good local honey, or find a good brand here)
* 3 tablespoons unflavored gelatin (we use this gelatin from grass fed cows)

gummy bear silicone mold

### Strawberry Gummy Bears Ingredients

* ⅔ cup pureed strawberries (make sure they’re thawed to room temp if using frozen)
* ⅓ cup filtered water (find the water filtration system we use here)
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons honey (use local honey, or find a good brand here)
* 3 tablespoons unflavored gelatin (we use this gelatin from grass fed cows)
* gummy bear silicone mold (find one here)

### Blueberry Gummy Bears Ingredients

* ½ cup pureed blueberries (allow to thaw to room temp if using frozen)
* ½ cup filtered water (find the water filtration system we use here)
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* 3 tablespoons honey (use local honey, or find a good brand here)
* 3 tablespoons unflavored gelatin (find gelatin from grass fed cows here)
* gummy bear silicone mold (find one here)

### Method

* Combine all ingredients except gelatin in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir with a whisk.
* Gradually whisk gelatin into the mixture, stirring constantly. (Avoid dumping gelatin into pan all at once, which will cause big globs of gelatin to remain in finished product.)
* Continue heating over medium-low heat until all ingredients are well combined and gelatin is completely melted. (The mixture will change from a grainy, jelly-like consistency to a more glassy, smooth consistency when gelatin is all melted.)
* Place gummy bear mold on a cookie sheet (which makes it easier to move without spilling once filled). Pour mixture into silicone mold and place in freezer for about 20-30 minutes.
* Pop gummy bears out of mold and store in an airtight container. They will keep in the refrigerator for a few weeks.

### Note

* You can also pour mixture into a baking dish greased with coconut oil if you don’t have silicone molds. After mixture is set up, cut with a knife or use cookie cutters to make any shape you like.
