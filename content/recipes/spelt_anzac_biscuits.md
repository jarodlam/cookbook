* 70g dessicated coconut
* 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
* 1/2 tsp baking soda

### Method

* Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celcius.
* Place flour, sugar, oats or quinoa flakes, coconut and sea salt into Thermomix bowl, and mix 10 sec/speed 3.
* Mix baking soda and boiling water together in a cup, to dissolve the soda.
* Add remaining ingredients to Thermomix and mix 10 sec/speed 3, or until combined and beginning to clump together. (The mixture should be able to be pressed together with your hands, and not fall apart.)
* Form mixture into walnut sized balls and flatten (with your fingers) on greased or lined trays, to about 5mm in thickness.
* Bake in moderate oven for 15 to 20 minutes, then cool on the trays so they'll get nice and crisp.
