### Ingredients

* 2-3 chicken breasts (or 4 thigh), cut in 2cm pieces
* 50 g oyster sauce
* 50 g soy sauce
* 1 spring onion
* 2 Garlic Cloves Peeled
* 200 g basmati rice, (200-400g)
* vegetables of choice to steam
* 500g water

### Method

* Chop garlic and spring onion for 3 seconds, speed 6
* Add soy and oyster sauce and mix for 4 seconds, speed 4
* Add chicken pieces to marinade mixture and stir for 2 seconds, counter-clockwise operation speed 3.
* Leave chicken in TM bowl and put whole bowl and lid in fridge if possible to marinade for 1-2 hrs (you can skip this step if you are short on time, but it will taste nicer if you can leave it to marinade for a while)
* Tip chicken out of TM bowl onto top tray of Varoma and spread evenly, ensuring there are steam holes visible.  DON'T WASH THE TM BOWL!!
        * Optional: Add vegetables of choice to bottom half of Varoma (you may want to do this with only 10 minutes remaining if you have soft vegetables, but harder vegetables like carrots etc can take the 20 minutes to steam. Use your steaming guide in the front of your EDC to decide when to add the vegetables)
* Insert basket into TM bowl. Weigh rice (between 200-400g depending on how much you need for your family. We use around 200g for 2 adults and 3 small children). Add 500g of water. To rinse rice, put the lid on and turn speed up to 4 for 5 seconds or so until the rice is all wet (look through the top while it is rinsing)
* Cook on Varoma temperature for 20 minutes, speed 2
* Use your spatula to remove basket of rice and tip into a Thermoserver, then add chicken and vegetables and serve.
