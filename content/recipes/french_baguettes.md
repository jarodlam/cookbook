### Ingredients

* 2 tsp salt
* 650g bakers flour
* 350g warm water
* 2tsp granulated yeast 

### Method

* Place ingredients into Thermomix bowl in the order listed. (We are keeping salt away from the yeast). Mix 15sec/speed 6-7.
* Knead 3 min/Interval. Allow to 'rest' for 5-10 minutes. 
* Knead again 3 min/Interval.
* Turn out into oiled bowl and cover completely with plastic wrap so the air will be trapped and allow to double. (This may take up to 3 hours, unless you have the Kleenmaid warming drawer in which case probably about 20 minutes rising time).
* The dough will be quite hard and dense and yet flexible.
* When happy with the rise, punch down and roll into two rectangular shapes. Fold in both long sides into towards each other. Tuck in the ends and seal all together by pinching the dough together.
* Turn over so that the seam is down and you have a nice smooth top. Place onto baking paper and allow to rise again. Cover with plastic wrap.
* Preheat pizza stone in a 220ÂºC oven.
* No pizza stone? Use the 30 minutes for this rise to go buy one! You need it!
* When ready to cook, slice several slashes across the dough. Place in steam oven and steam for 10 minutes.
* Transfer to hot oven and cook for a further 10-15 minutes. Loaf should sound hollow when tapped.
