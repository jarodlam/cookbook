### Tips

* Using clean sterilized jars will help keep the flavour of your home made preserves fresher for longer! Remember always add hot food to hot jars and only remove jars from the oven when they are needed as they will cool down too much!
* You can make lime butter by substituting the lemon juice with the juice from 2 limes.
* To sterilise jars: When I searched the net, there seemed 101 ways to sterilise a jar! Wash mine in hot soapy water, give it a rinse, and then place it on a baking tray lined with a tea towel in an oven at 120C for 15 minutes.
