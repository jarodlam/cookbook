### Method

* Measure all ingredients except the butter into the TM bowl (flour and yeast should be last). Milk, cream and egg can be cold as the kneading will warm the ingredients.
* Mix on speed 4 for a few seconds to combine then set to knead for 8 minutes.
* Add in the butter (cold) and knead a further 2 minutes until butter is incorporated and dough is smooth and elastic. 
* Shape the dough into a ball and place into a greased bowl. Cover with a tea towel and leave for 30-40 minutes till doubled in size. 
* Turn out the dough onto a baking mat, punch down the dough, then shape.
* Allow the dough to rise for another 30 minutes. 
* Brush with milk or beaten egg before baking at 180Â°C 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.

* Note: The recipe yielded 8 rolls, about the size of a small hamburger bun after baking.
