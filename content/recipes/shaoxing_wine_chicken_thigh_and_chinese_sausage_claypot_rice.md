### Ingredients

* 4 chicken thighs, about 3/4 lb each
* 1 cup long grain rice, uncooked
* 2 Chinese sausage, thinly sliced on the diagonal
* 1 pack enoki mushrooms, about 7oz, wash and separated
* 1 scallion, chopped

### Ingredients for the Chicken Thigh Marinade

* 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 1 tsp fish sauce
* 2 tsp soy sauce
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp white pepper
* 1/2 tsp garlic granule
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 tsp oil

### Ingredients for the Sauce

* 4 tsp sesame oil
* 4 tsp soy sauce
* 2 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp water
* 2 tsp fish sauce

### Method

* In a large bowl, combine the ingredients for the chicken thigh marinade (Shaoxing wine, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, white pepper, garlic granule, salt, and oil). Mix well and add the chicken thighs. Mix and set aside in the refrigerator. Marinate for at least 1 hour or overnight.
* When ready to cook, heat a large non-stick skillet on medium-high heat for 1 minute. Place chicken thighs in the pan. Do not overcrowd the pan. Work in batches if necessary. Pan-fry the thighs 15 minutes on each side on medium heat. Thighs should be golden brown and about 80% percent done after 30 minutes. Set chicken thighs aside when they are done.
* While the chicken thighs are cooking, wash and drain thoroughly 1 cup of long grain rice. Place rice in a large bowl and add 1 cup of cold water. Soak the rice in the water for 30 minutes.
* When the chicken thighs are done and set aside, heat a large cast iron pot on medium heat. Add the sliced Chinese sausages. Saut√©ed the sausages for 1 to 2 minutes until they begin to release oil and are a little crispy. Add the soaked rice with the water into the cast iron pot. Mix. With the lid off, bring water, rice, and sausage to a simmer.
* Once the pot starts to simmer, add the chicken thighs on top of the rice. Place enoki mushrooms around the thighs. Place the lid on top of the pot, turn flame down to second lowest setting, and cook for 30 minutes.
* While the rice and chicken is cooking, make the sauce. Combine sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, water, and fish sauce together. Mix well. Add half of the chopped scallions. Divide sauce among 2 or 4 small bowls.
* After 30 minutes, the rice and chicken should be done. To serve, bring the cast iron pot to the table. Sprinkle remaining scallions on top and lightly drizzle sesame oil on top of the enoki mushrooms. Place 1 or 2 chicken thighs and some rice on plate. Drizzle a little bit of the sauce on top of the chicken and rice. Enjoy immediately.
