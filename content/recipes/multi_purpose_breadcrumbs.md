### Ingredients

•3 slices bread

* 50g salami
* 30g semi dried tomatoes
* 1 brown onion
* 200g cubed cheese
* 2 cloves garlic
* ½ bunch parsley
* Salt & Pepper

### Method

* Place all ingredients into TMX bowl and chop 10 seconds using spatula to help.  You may need to remove lid and scrap sides down. 
* If adding to mince for burger patties, also add 1 whole egg to bind.
* These bread crumbs are great to use for stuffing, mixing through mince to make burger patties and they freeze well.  Will make enough to stuff 3 chickens.
