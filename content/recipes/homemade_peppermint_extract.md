### Ingredients

* 1 cup fresh mint leaves
* 1 1/2 to 2 cups of vodka

### Method

* Harvest the mint, and give it a quick rinse. Pat dry.
* Remove the leaves from the stems, and discard the stems.
* Crush and smash the leaves in your hands.
* Place the leaves in a pint-sized glass jar, and fill the jar the rest of the way with vodka.
* Give it a shake and set aside in a cool, dark place.
* Allow the mixture to steep for one to two months.
* Strain the leaves, and bottle the finished extract.

### Notes

* The amounts on this don’t have to be exact- feel to use more or less mint/vodka. The most important thing is that you completely cover the leaves with the alcohol, so they don’t mold.
* I usually use the cheapest vodka I can find for my extracts.
