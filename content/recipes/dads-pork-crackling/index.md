## Ingredients
* Pork belly
* Salt
* Oil (olive oil or similar)
* Five-spice powder (optional)

## Method
* A few days beforehand, place the pork belly on a plate and rub a generous amount of salt onto the skin. Leave uncovered in the fridge to dry out the skin.
* Take out the pork belly. Rub all surfaces with oil. Optionally add five-spice powder for a more Chinese flavour.
* Place pork belly into a turbo cooker. Put a plate or pan underneath to collect the oil. Use a turbo cooker extender ring if available. The top of the pork belly should not have any place for oil to pool---if it does, prop up the middle of the pork belly by placing a small dish underneath.
* Cook at 160째C for 20 minutes until the skin has softened. Take out the pork and slice lines into the skin 1cm apart.
* Put back and cook at 160째C for 40-60 more minutes. Cook longer to render the fat more.
* Increase the temperature to 220째C and cook until skin is crispy. Then increase to 250째C and cook for 5 minutes. Watch very carefully while on high heat to ensure it doesn't burn.
* Rest the meat on a chopping board for at least 10 minutes. Slice and serve.
