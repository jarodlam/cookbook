## Ingredients
* Pork belly
* Salt
* Oil (olive oil or similar)
* Five-spice powder (optional)

## Method
1. A few days beforehand, place the pork belly on a plate and rub a generous amount of salt onto the skin. Leave uncovered in the fridge to dry out the skin. Put a few layers of paper towel under the pork belly to soak up moisture.
2. Take out the pork belly. Rub all surfaces with oil. Optionally add five-spice powder for a more Chinese flavour.
3. Place pork belly into a turbo cooker. Put a plate or pan underneath to collect the oil. Use a turbo cooker extender ring if available. The top of the pork belly should not have any place for oil to pool---if it does, prop up the middle of the pork belly by placing a small dish underneath.
4. Cook at 160째C for 20 minutes until the skin has softened. Take out the pork and slice lines into the skin 1cm apart.
5. Put back and cook at 160째C for 40-60 more minutes. Cook longer to render the fat more.
6. Increase the temperature to 220째C and cook until skin is crispy. Then increase to 250째C and cook for 5 minutes. Watch very carefully while on high heat to ensure it doesn't burn.
7. Rest the meat on a chopping board for at least 10 minutes. Slice and serve.
