### Ingredients

* 5-1/2 Tbs unsalted butter, diced, + extra for greasing the pan
* 5 cups whole milk
* 4-1/8 cups all purpose flour
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 2  eggs
* 4 Tbs sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/4 cup lemon juice, pulp free
* 1 tsp lemon zest, freshly grated
* 1 tsp orange zest, freshly grated
* 1/3 cup orange juice, pulp free

### Method

* In a deep saucepan, melt the butter into 3-½ cups of milk over very low heat. Remove from the heat as soon as the butter is melted. Let the milk cool completely.
* Using a handheld mixer, whisk the eggs with the sugar until you get a pale, yellow foam. It'll take about 6 minutes. The consistency must be very airy. Add the vanilla extract.
* Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Sift the dry ingredients. Form a well in the center of the bowl. Pour in the egg mixture, lemon and orange zests, juices and butter/ milk liquid. Mix until the batter is smooth. Do NOT over-mix.
* Let the crêpe batter rest for at least 2-3 hours. Thin the crêpe batter with the remaining milk (up to 1-½ cups).
* Place your crêpe pan (or any flat pan) over medium heat. Grease it with a little butter using a silicone brush. Pour about 1/2 cup of the batter in the center of the pan. Lift the pan and then tilt and rotate it until the batter is evenly spread and forms a nice thin disk. Put it back on the stove. It should start bubbling after a few seconds. Leave it alone.
* The crêpe batter should cook for about a minute before it's time to flip. When the edges look dry and start separating from the pan, take a long flat spatula and lift around the crêpe. Flip the crêpe and cook the other side for another 30 seconds.
* Garnish with some strawberry jam, vanilla-flavored whipped cream and fresh strawberries. Decorate with some fresh mint, and dust with powdered sugar.

### Tips

* The longer you let the batter rest the better. It will still be good after 2-3 days in the refrigerator.
* My secret for perfect crêpe batter is to melt the butter with the milk. Let the mix cool completely, then add the rest of the ingredients.

Bon appétit!
