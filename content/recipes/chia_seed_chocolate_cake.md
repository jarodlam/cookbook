### Ingredients

* 8 tablespoons Chia seeds
* 250 ml water
* 90 g raw cocoa
* 250 g unsalted butter, softened
* 10 eggs
* 350 g almond meal
* 320 g coconut palm sugar
* 1 pinch salt
* 2 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda

### Ingredients- Dulcey chocolate ganache

* 400 g cream
* 750 g Valrhona Dulcey chocolate
* 100 g dark chocolate shavings

### Method

* Preheat the oven to 180c and line two spring mounted cake tins with baking paper. Soak the chia seeds in the water for 15 minutes, make sure to stir the seeds regularly so that they absorb the water and break down to a jelly.
* Place all remaining ingredients in a separate bowl, mix together until smooth. Add the chia seed jelly and combine well.
* Divide the mix between the two prepared cake tins and bake in the pre heated oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Check the cakes are cooked by placing a clean knife or cake skewer in the centre and if it comes out clean remove from the oven and allow the cakes to rest in the tins for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the tins and allow to cool on a wire rack.
* To make the Dulcey chocolate ganache, use a medium saucepan over a low heat, add the cream and bring to a simmer. Place the Dulcey chocolate in a heat proof bowl and pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Allow this to sit for 1 minute then whisk until the mixture is smooth.
* Place this in the fridge for 45 minutes to set. When you are ready to assemble the cake, lightly whisk the chocolate to whip it up a bit. Spread half of the chocolate on the top of one of the cakes then sandwich it with the other, spread the remaining half of the chocolate on the top and then scatter over the chocolate shavings.
