### Ingredients

* 3 dried red chillis (could use more or less)
* 1 red capsicum
* 30g lemon juice
* 2 tbsp smoked paprika
* 80g balsamic vinegar
* 4 garlic cloves
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp oregano
* 90g olive oil
* Pepper to taste
* 2-4 chicken breasts (or thighs)

### Method

* Add all ingredients except chicken to bowl and blitz on Speed 8 for 30 seconds or until preferred consistency is reached.
* Lay chicken breasts/thighs between greaseproof paper and tenderise to even the size.  
* Place chicken in a container or bag, cover with marinade and leave for as long as possible. (Tip: I score the chicken as well to get the flavour right in there).
* Cooking in Varoma - Put 1000g of water in bowl, lay a sheet of wet greaseproof paper in varoma and add chicken.  Cook for 25 minutes at Varoma Speed 4.  Check that chicken is cooked.  You can fry off quickly to give a more bbq flavour or serve as is.  
* Cooking in the oven - Lay on baking paper and cook at 180deg for 20 minutes.
* Great in burgers/wraps or with a salad.  Tip: Reserve some of the marinade prior to putting on chicken and add to mayonnaise.

### Tip

* Here's a great tip, plan ahead.  Buy a heap of chicken thighs and portion them into snap lock bags, then add the sauce.  Put them in the freezer so when you don't feel like cooking you can just defrost and bake in the oven (20 mins 180deg).  Either with a salad or in a fresh bun you are going to love this.
