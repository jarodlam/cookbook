### Ingredients

* 1/4 cup shea butter 
* 1/8 cup sweet almond oil 
* 1 tablespoon beeswax 
* 10 drops myrrh essential oil 
* 10 drops cedarwood essential oil

### Method

* Melt the shea butter, beeswax, and sweet almond oil together in a double boiler. (I just use a Pyrex measuring cup and place it in a pot of simmering water).
* Stir the mixture as it melts.
* Once everything is melted, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool for 5-10 minutes.
* Stir in the essential oils, and pour the liquid hand butter into a small glass container. Allow it to harden completely (this usually takes several hours).
* Apply the hand butter to your dry hands as often as needed–especially after a long day working outside or playing in the dirt.

### Notes

* Shea butter is known to provide powerful moisturizing and nourishing benefits for the skin.  You could also substitute half of the shea butter for 1/8 cup cocoa butter or coconut oil.
* Sweet almond oil is a wonderful moisturizer that also contains vitamins that nourish and soothe the skin. If you don’t have sweet almond, you can substitute jojoba oil, olive oil, etc.
* The beeswax in this recipe helps the hand butter to set up and stay firm. It also coats the skin and protects it. If you want your hand butter to be softer, try reducing the beeswax. If you would like it firmer, increase the amount of beeswax.
