This recipe from a kids' cookbook has been a favourite since primary scool. They were always a hit when brought to school.

These are a bit denser than normal brownies and quite sweet, so sugar should definitely be reduced here.

* 2 cups brown sugar (can be reduced to 1 3/4)
* 1 teaspoon imitation vanilla essence
