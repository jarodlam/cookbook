### Ingredients

* 5-6 drumsticks (about 1.5 ibs)
*  Spices - salt, pepper, garlic powder

### Method

* Preheat oven to 425 deg F (220 deg C). 
* Pat dry with paper towels.  Trim off any extra skin and loose join pieces.
* Add spices to taste. Here I’m using a light sprinkling of my 7:2:1 seasoning. If you don’t have that, mix 1 Tbl kosher salt, 1 tsp pepper and optionally 1/2 tsp garlic powder (granulated  preferred) and 1/4 tsp Cayenne (skip for little ones). This makes more than you need. Keep for next time.
* Placed on a prepared cooking pan with the thicker part of the drumstick to the outside. I usually line with aluminum foil to help cleanup. A rack elevates the chicken to help all sides cook evenly. You can do it without the rack but better with. Of course, a heavy spray of PAM on the rack or foil.
* Cook to 185 plus internal temp. DO NOT STOP SHORT of 185. About 35 minutes in my oven. Let set for 10 minutes before serving. They are way too hot to eat right away and will be better after a rest.
