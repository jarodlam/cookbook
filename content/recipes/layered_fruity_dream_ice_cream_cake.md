### Ingredients

* 350 grams Frozen strawberries
* 350 grams Frozen Oranges
* 350 grams Frozen Mixed Berries
* 3 egg whites
* 180 grams raw sugar

### Method

* Place all sugar into TM Closed lid and pulverise for 20 seconds on speed 9.

Set aside.

* You need 60grams per layer (or less if you wish) - but much easier to pulverise it all in one hit while you have a clean dry bowl.
* Place 60 grams of the sugar that you have just set aside into TM, Closed lid. 
* Add Frozen Strawberries (or fruit of your choice) and chop for 10 seconds on speed 8. 
* Scrape down sides of bowl with spatula.
* Insert Butterfly and add egg white and mix for 45 seconds on speed 4 or until you have a soft consistency.
* Pour first layer into a cheesecake spring form tin (mine is 21cm in diameter). Flatten the mixture with the spatula. 
* Place tin into freezer for half an hour.
* Then repeat the same for the next two layers.  (remember to put in freezer each time for approximately 30 minutes).  This will just make it easier to pour the next layer on.
* Freeze for a few hours before required.

### Tip

* Before you unclip the springform tin to open it - go around the edge of the tin with a knife to loosen away from the tin.
