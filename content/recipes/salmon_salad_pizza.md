### Method - Sauce & Topping

* Meanwhile, make sauce by placing tomatoes, garlic, herbs, vinegar, sugar, salt, tomato puree and chili into mixing bowl.  Combine 4 sec/speed 6.
* Divide dough into two,roll out into two bases and place on paper-lined or oiled pizza trays.  Brush with additional olive oil.
* Spread sauce over pizzas, leaving about 3 tbl in mixing bowl for the salad.  
* Divide salmon and mozzarella between bases and bake one at a time (250 deg C) until crisp (approx 15 mins).

### Method - Salad Topping

* While pizzas are baking, place onions, parsley, basil, oil, lemon juice and salt into mixing bowl and chop 3 sec/speed 5.
* Add olives and baby leaf salad and stir 4 sec/reverse/speed 2.
* Top each pizza with salad mixture and serve hot.

### Tips

* This pizza dough does not need to rise like regular bread dough does, as you want it thin and crispy.  It will rise just enough during baking.
