### Method

* To make the roasted curry powder, place a medium sized fry pan over low heat, add all spices and curry leaves and dry-roast for about 10 minutes, until spices smell delicious and have turned slightly golden. *Place spices and curry leaves in a mortar and pestle, allow to cool, then grind until you form a fine powder. 
* This alternatively can be done in a coffee grinder or Thermomix. Set aside. 
* To make the curry place a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add oil and gently fry onions until translucent then add remaining ingredients in order that they are listed. 
* After you have added the coconut milk, reduce heat to low or a gentle simmer and cook pumpkin until tender. 
* If coconut milk is reducing too quickly, add more coconut milk, you do not want a dry curry. 
* To make roasted rice and coconut powder, place a small fry pan over medium heat add rice and dry-roast until golden, this may take up to 10 minutes.  
* Remove from fry pan and then repeat process with coconut, this should only take a few minutes. 
* Place roasted rice and coconut in a mortar and pestle and grind to a paste. Set aside. 
* Once pumpkin is tender, add 2 heaped teaspoons of roasted curry powder and roasted rice and coconut powder, stir until combined.
* Serve with steamed rice and other Sri Lankan accompaniments like dahl and roti.
*  Enjoy!
