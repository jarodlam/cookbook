### Note

* This is the recipe for pickled watermelon rind which I converted for TM5. If I'm making a big batch I actually prefer to do it the old fashioned way on the stove top because you can double the quantities in this recipe. They make a lovely, unique gift. Personally, I think the watermelon slices stayed neater when it was cooked on the stove top but I'm a stickler for that kind of thing. 

### Ingredients

* 30g salt
* 500ml water
* 500g watermelon rind (green skin and pink flesh removed), cut into 5cm strips

### Syrup & Aromatics

* 500g sugar
* 10g peppercorns
* 315g white wine vinegar
* 1/2 tsp cloves
* 1 cinnamon quill
* 1 star anise
* 2 strips orange peel (with pith removed)

### TM Method

* Dissolved salt in 500ml water in glass bowl.  
* Add watermelon rind, cover, leave at room temp for 8hrs.
* Drain and arrange in single layers in Varoma dish & tray.
* Put Varoma on TM.  Add 600g fresh water to TM bowl & steam, rind for 30mins/Varoma/Sp1.  Discard water.
* Add 250ml water, white wine vinegar, sugar, pepper, cloves, cinnamon, star anise & range peel to bowl.  Simmer 15mins/95 deg/SP1.
* Add watermelon, rind, simmer 50mins/95 deg/Reverse/Sp1 (for softer rind, cook an extra 10-20mins).
* Transfer to sterilised jars, allow to cool or seal safety (not turning upside down).  Refrigerate 2 weeks before serving.

### Non-TM Method

* Dissolve salt in 500ml water in glass bowl.    
* Add watermelon rind, cover, leave at room temp for 8hrs.
* Drain and put in large saucepan.  Cover with water and bring to boil.  Reduce to simmer for 10-15mins until rind is tender.  Drain.
* Put sugar, peppercorns, vinegar, cloves, cinnamon, orange rind and 250ml water in saucepan over low heat for 15mins, stirring to dissolve sugar.
* Bring to boil for 5mins.  
* Add rind and simmer uncovered for 30-45mins until rind is transparent and syrup thick.
* Transfer to sterilised jar, allow to cool or use a safe sealing method (not turning upside down).
* Refrigerate 2 weeks before serving.
