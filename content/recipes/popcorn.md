### Ingredients
* Unpopped popcorn kernels
* Flavacol flavouring
* Butter

### Method
* Heat up an empty saucepan on a stove for a few minutes.
* Melt the butter in the pan. Don't worry if it turns brown, just make sure it doesn't turn black because that means it is burnt.
* Add 3 popcorn kernels to the pan and wait until they pop. This tells you when the butter is hot enough to pop popcorn and reduces the amount of unpopped kernels.
* Add the rest of the popcorn and sprinkle the Flavacol evenly.
* Put on the lid. Shake the saucepan vigorously until the popcorn stops popping.
* Empty the popcorn into a large bowl. Sprinkle extra Flavacol if the seasoning is inadequate. Enjoy.
