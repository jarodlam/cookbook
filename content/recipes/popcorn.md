## Ingredients
* Unpopped popcorn kernels
* Flavacol flavouring
* Butter

## Method
1. Heat up an empty saucepan on a stove for a few minutes.
2. Melt the butter in the pan. Don't worry if it turns brown, just make sure it doesn't turn black because that means it is burnt.
3. Add 3 popcorn kernels to the pan and wait until they pop. This tells you when the butter is hot enough to pop popcorn and reduces the amount of unpopped kernels.
4. Add the rest of the popcorn and sprinkle the Flavacol evenly.
5. Put on the lid. Shake the saucepan vigorously until the popcorn stops popping.
6. Empty the popcorn into a large bowl. Sprinkle extra Flavacol if the seasoning is inadequate. Enjoy.
