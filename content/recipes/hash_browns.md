### Ingredients

* 6 medium (about 1.2kg) desiree potatoes, peeled
* 2 tbs plain flour
* 1 egg, lightly whisked
* Pinch of salt
* Vegetable oil, to shallow-fry

### Method

* Preheat oven to 120°C. Line a baking tray with paper towel. Coarsely grate the potatoes into a colander. Use your hands to squeeze out as much excess liquid as possible. Transfer potatoes to a bowl.
* Add the flour, egg and salt to the potato, and stir until well combined. Divide mixture into 12 equal portions.
* Add enough oil to a large deep frying pan to reach a depth of 2cm. Heat to 190°C over medium-high heat (when oil is ready a cube of bread will turn golden brown in 15 seconds). Spoon 4 portions of potato mixture around the edge of the pan and flatten slightly to form 8cm discs. 
* Shallow-fry for 3 minutes or until golden underneath. Turn and shallow-fry for a further 2 minutes or until crisp. 
* Use an egg lifter to transfer hash browns to prepared tray and place in preheated oven to keep warm. 
* Repeat in 2 more batches with the remaining potato mixture, reheating and topping up oil between batches if necessary. Season hash browns with salt to serve.

### Notes

* Add some grated cheese for added flavour. Yum!
