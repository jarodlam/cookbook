### Ingredients

* 1 large bunch curly kale (about 200g. after thick stems removed)
* 1 fresh red bell pepper, medium sized (sweet pepper, capsicum)
* about 20-25 g. nutritional yeast flakes (equal to one full measuring cap) (NOT baker’s yeast! and not to be confused with Brewer’s yeast)
* 1-2 cloves garlic
* 100 g. raw cashews (soaked for at least an hour, and rinsed)
* 1/2 lemon 
* 1 Tbsp soy sauce or tamari
* 25g light oil
* sprinkle of salt (optional)
* small or large pinch of chili flakes (optional)
* sesame seeds (plain or toasted) for sprinkling on top (optional but really nice!)

### Method

* Prepare Ingredients: ensure your cashews have soaked for at least an hour and are rinsed before starting. Peel the lemon and cut in half (optionally you can first grate the skin and retain zest for sprinkling on chips later). Remove stem and seed from pepper and chop into quarters. Wash and dry kale in a salad spinner. Remove the thickest part of the stems. Tear the leaves into smaller pieces as shown in photos below. Place the cleaned and prepared kale leaves in your kitchen’s largest mixing bowl. Prepare two cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper and keep these close to your work area. Turn on oven to its lowest setting (about 70°C-80°C or 160°F-180°F)
* Put cashews, yeast flakes, pepper, garlic, oil, soy sauce, peeled lemon (chili flakes if using) into Thermomix bowl.
* Process 1 minute/speed 8. Carefully remove lid and using spatula push sauce down from sides of bowl and lid. Process again 1 minute/speed 8.
* Roll up sleeves because now the messy fun is about to start!
* Pour sauce onto kale in the large bowl. Use hands to massage and smush the sauce into the kale so leaves are completely coated. Stand back and admire your work. Resist temptation to lick hands.
* Use messy hands to place kale pieces on prepared trays ensuring there is only one layer of kale on each tray. Kale pieces should not overlap if possible so try to distribute evenly. (Here you may choose to add an optional sprinkling of salt, sesame seeds, and/or lemon zest.)
* As with comedy, so with kale chips: “Timing is everything!” Set kitchen timer for 4 hours. At half-way point remove trays and turn over each leaf. Notice they have started to shrink. They will appear cheezy and limp. Don’t even think about tasting now or you will be disappointed. Return trays to oven and continue baking for two more hours. The goal is to ‘dry’ them, rather than ‘roast’ them. After four hours your chips should appear dry and crispy. Do not let them get too crispy as they can quickly begin to burn. (To test, lift one off the parchment and check if it is stiff.) Allow chips to cool on trays. Prepare for the unexpected. Enjoy!

### Variations

* This is a very forgiving recipe I have done many substitutions with varying success: cream cheese instead of cashews, a whole peeled orange instead of lemon juice, balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice, sea salt instead of soy sauce, coriander, oyster sauce, parmesan etc. Try if first as shown above and then play with the recipe to suit yourself.
