### Ingredients

* 2 ripe bananas, quartered 
* 10g coconut oil (liquefied) 
* 1 tbsp golden flaxseeds (linseeds) 
* 140g whole oats 
* 120g wholemeal spelt flour 
* 1 pinch salt 
* 40-50g Raw caster sugar 
* 1/2 tsp bicarb soda 
* 1 tsp baking powder 
* 1 large egg 
* 2 MC of low-fat natural or vanilla yoghurt 
* 2 MC of skim milk 
* 2 tsp vanilla bean paste or extract 
* sliced fresh fruit of choice (e.g. kiwi, blueberries, strawberries)

### Method

* Add flaxseeds and oats to the TM bowl and mill for 20 seconds on speed 9 with the MC lid on. Decant into a bowl and put aside.
* Place rip bananas in TM bowl and mash for a few seconds on speed 4. Return the ground flax and oats to the bowl and add all remaining ingredients. Mix for 20 seconds on speed 5 until smooth. 
* Heat a large non-stick frypan on medium heat and grease with a little coconut oil or butter. Pour about 2 tablespoons at a time onto the hot pan. Sprinkle a few blueberries or add thinly sliced fruit on top of each pancake as it cooks. Cook for about 2 minutes on each side or until bubbles begin to form, turn over and cook the other side. Turn the heat to low as the pan heats up.
* To serve, sprinkle with a little sieved icing sugar or drizzled with honey or syrup. Also delicious with a smear of TM lemon butter! Enjoy.
