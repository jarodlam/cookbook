### Note

* I love the way this tastes like it has yoghurt in it, but is completely dairy free! The secret is the creamy cashew or almond milk with lime and banana - so simple. The colour doesn't always look so good with creamy berry green smoothies, and I find you need to drink them quickly or they turn greyish - but they really do taste delicious. Just drink it up quickly before the colour changes.

### Ingredients

* 100g raw cashews or blanched almonds
* 2 frozen bananas, quartered
* 100g frozen blueberries
* 1 lime, peeled
* 2 big handfuls of ice
* 1-2 big handfuls of cos lettuce or baby spinach
* 300g coconut water or water

### Method

* Grind up the dry nuts first for 10 seconds on speed 9.
* Add remaining ingredients and blend on speed 10 for 2 minutes.
