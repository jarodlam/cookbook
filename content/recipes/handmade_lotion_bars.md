### Ingredients

* 2oz. coconut oil
* 2oz. shea butter (or cocoa butter)
* 2oz. bees wax pellets
* 2 capsules vitamin E
* essential oils for scent (optional)
* soap mould (plastic or silicone)
* microwave safe bowl (disposable works great too)

### Method

* Melt your shea butter, bees wax and coconut oil in the microwave in 20 second intervals.
* It will take a couple of minutes. Here it is after 60 seconds. Just stir well after each interval. Below is what it will look like when it is completely melted.
* Cut the tip off of the vitamin E capsule and add it to your liquid mixture.
* Add lemon and lime essential oils, to your liking. As a reference, I used about 15 drops of each. Stir after adding the oils. If your mixture is lightly scented, add a few more drops and give it another whiff. If it smells just right, add a couple of more drops as it sometimes seems to lose potency when it has hardened.
* Pour your mixture into your moulds.
* Allow to sit until tops start to look solid (about 15 minutes). Carefully move to the refrigerator and allow to set completely, about 30 minutes.
* Pop your lotion bars out of the moulds.
* 2 oz. of bees wax will make a nice firm bar. If you’d like a softer bar that reacts to the heat of your skin quicker, you can lower the amount of bees wax to 1.5 oz. or even 1 oz. The beauty of the melt and pour method is that if you don’t like the consistency you can change it! If it is too hard, re-melt it and add a more coconut oil or shea butter and let it set up again. If it is too soft for you liking, add a little more beeswax. It’s completely up to you. Just use my measurements as a starting point.
* To use, wrap your fingers around your bar. The warmth from your skin will activate the oils and leave a soft and smooth residue. A little bit goes a long way. Rub into your hands and allow it to absorb. Your hands will thank you!
