### Ingredients-Presoak

* 100 g mixed grains/seeds
* 50 g boiling water

### Ingredients-Dough

* 280 g water
* 1.5 tsp Sugar (optional)
* 2 tsp dried instant yeast
* 470 g white bakers flour
* 1.5 tsp salt
* 1.5 tsp bread improver (optional but helps to produce a fluffy loaf)
* 1 tbsp oil

### Method

* ADD YOUR PRESOAK INGREDIENTS TO A SMALL BOWL & STIR. SIT THIS ASIDE FOR HALF HOUR TO ALLOW THE GRAIN/SEED MIX TO ABSORB THE BOILING WATER.
* ADD ALL DOUGH INGREDIENTS TO THE BOWL IN THE ORDER LISTED. COMBINE 15 SECONDS, SPEED 3. NOW ADD YOUR PRESOAK MIX & KNEAD 6 MINUTES (DOUGH FUNCTION).
* NOW LET YOUR DOUGH REST FOR 15 MINUTES. YOU CAN LEAVE IT IN THE THERMOMIX BOWL, IN AN OILED BOWL COVERED, OR A THERMOMAT.
* PLACE YOUR DOUGH ON AN OILED BENCH & KNOCK DOWN (PUNCH TILL YOU RELEASE ALL THE GAS/AIR FROM THE DOUGH).
* ROLL YOUR DOUGH INTO A TIGHT LOG, & COAT IN SEEDS/GRAINS (EASIEST WAY IS TO FILL A TRAY WITH MIX AND SQUISH THE DOUGH IN IT). PLACE YOUR DOUGH IN A JUMBO TIN AND SQUISH DOWN TO COVER THE BOTTOM OF THE TIN.
* PLACE YOUR TIN IN A WARM SPOT & ALLOW TO PROVE UNTIL IT REACHES THE TOP OF YOUR 900G JUMBO TIN.
* BAKE IN A PREHEATED OVEN ON 180â—¦ FOR 25 MINUTES OR UNTIL GOLDEN BROWN. TIP OUT OF TIN IMMEDIATELY TO COOL.

### Tips

* Find the fastest way to prove, is in your oven with a tray of boiling water. Close your oven door and leave it switched off. The steamy environment will make your dough prove very fast!
