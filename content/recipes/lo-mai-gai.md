Note to self: look up non-Bessemer method

## Ingredients
* 2 metric cups glutinous rice
* 2 pieces lup chong, sliced
* â…“ cup dried shrimp, re-hydrated in water then finely chopped
* ~10 dried shiitake mushrooms, re-hydrated then thickly sliced
* 3 chicken thigh fillets, cut into large cubes

* 1 clove garlic, crushed
* Fried onion
* Sauce (for chicken and rice):
  * Light soy sauce
  * Dark soy sauce
  * Oyster sauce
  * Cooking caramel
  * Sesame oil
  * Pepper

## Method
1. Rinse then soak glutinous rice in water for at least 2 hours.
2. Heat pan on medium. Stir-fry the ingredients then set aside:
  * *Lup chong:* Fry very briefly on medium heat, burns easily.
  * *Shrimp:* Also medium heat, watch out for splattering, fry until fragrant.
  * *Mushrooms:* Add small amount of water, cover and cook until water evaporated.
  * *Chicken:* Marinate in sauce ingredients then pan fry for a few minutes covered, stirring occasionally. No need to fully cook these, just brown the outside.
4. Stir-fry the onion and garlic until caramelised. Add rice and toast for a minute or so.
5. Add 2 cups water, sauces and some fried onion. Mix well.
6. Steam for roughly 20 minutes in rice cooker or Bessemer dutch oven.
