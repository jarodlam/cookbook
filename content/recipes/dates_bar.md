### Ingredients for filling

* 2 1/2 cups pitted dates, cut up - soaks in hot water for at least 10mins
* 1tsp bicarbonate of soda
* 250g boiling water 
* 50g raw sugar 
* 35g walnuts, optional 

### Ingredients for Crumble

* 200g plain flour 
* 1 teaspoon salt 
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
* 140g rolled oats 
* 125g brown sugar 
* 125g butter, softened 
* 2 tablespoons water 

### Method

* Roughly chop walnuts in TM bowl for 2secs/Sp6. Set aside.
* Add soaked dates, bicarbonate of soda & boiling water to TM bowl.  Cook for 3mins/100°C/speed soft.
* Add sugar.  Mix 7secs/Sp6.
* Add walnut.  Mix 5sec/reverse speed/Sp5. Set aside and let cool.  
* Add Crumble ingredients to TM bowl.  Mix on Closed lid/Turbo for a couple of seconds until desired consistency.  You want the butter to be in chunks so do not over process.  
* Add water and turbo a couple of times. 
* Pat half into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking pan. Spread with date mixture; cover with remaining Crumble mixture and pat lightly.  
* Bake at 180°C for 35-40 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into bars. 
* Yield: 40 bars.
