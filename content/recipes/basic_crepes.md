* Preheat the cooking plate on temperature setting 2 then pour approx. 1/4cup of batter onto the centre of the cooking plate.  Quickly spread the batter in circular movements using the batter spreader until desired diameter of the crepe is achieved.
* Allow the crepe to cook until the top surface is no longer runny, about 40-50 seconds, and the crepe can be moved slightly on the cooking plate.
* Insert a large plastic food slide under the crepe and turn the crepe over to cook the other side.  Cook until just golden.  Do not overcook.
* Remove crepe from cooking plate using a large heatproof plastic food slide and place onto a storage plate. 
* Repeat with remaining batter, stacking crepes onto a storage plate with pieces of grease-proof paper in between each crepe to prevent sticking.
