## Ingredients
* 1.5 kg chicken pieces
* 150 g [rempah]({{< ref "/recipes/rempah" >}})
* 1 onion, diagonally sliced
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 6 cloves
* 4 star anise
* 5 cardamom pods
* 2 lemongrass (white part only), smashed
* 1 cup coconut milk
* 8 kaffir lime leaves, bruised
* 7 tbsp toasted grated coconut (kerisik), or desiccated coconut
* 1 tbsp sugar or to taste
* Salt to taste

## Method
1. Heat oil in a frying pan/pot. Add onion, fry till caramelised.
2. Add Nyonya spice paste, cinnamon stick, cloves, star anise and cardamom pods. Fry until aromatic.
3. Add chicken pieces & lemongrass. Stir to combine well with the spices.
4. Add coconut milk and 1 cup water. Don't add too much water or else the sauce won't reduce--the chicken also releases water when cooked.
5. Simmer on medium heat, stirring frequently until chicken is almost cooked (approx 15mins).
6. Add kaffir lime leaves & toasted coconut. Mix well.
7. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30mins or until chicken is tender and liquid has dried up.
8. Add sugar and salt to taste.
9. Serve with [turmeric rice]({{< ref "/recipes/turmeric-rice" >}}).
