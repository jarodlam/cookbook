* Add rock salt, red wine, bay leaf, clove and reserved mince meat.  Cook 25mins/Varoma/Speed 2, placing simmering basket instead of measuring cup onto mixing bowl lid.  Mixture will thicken and become fairly dry.
*  Remove simmering basket, insert measuring cup and blend 1min/speed 7.  Transfer into an airtight container and allow to cool before using or storing in the refrigerator.

### Tips

* 1 tbl stock paste is roughly equivalent to 1 shop-bought meat stock cube.
* To make meat stock, use 1tbl per 500g water.
* Stock paste keeps in the refrigerator for several months.
* The salt in this recipe is used as the preservation agent.  When mixed with water as described above, the stock does not taste too salty.
* If you wish to decrease the salt in the recipe, we recommend you store the stock in the freezer.
* Small quantity of sea vegetables, such as dulse, wakame or kombu, can be added to stock for extra flavour and nutrients.
* Use a mixture of red and white wine for this recipe, if desired.

### Variation

* Adapt this recipe using leftover vegetables you have in your refrigerator.  Weigh what you have into the mixing bowl to ensure the weight is consistent with the recipe.
