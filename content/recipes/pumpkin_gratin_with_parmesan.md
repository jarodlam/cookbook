### Ingredients

* Butter (for the dish) 
* 1 (4- to 5-pound) sugar pumpkin, stemmed and halved from stem to stern 
* Salt and pepper, to taste 
* 2 teaspoons flour 
* 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves 
* 1 egg 
* 1¼ cups heavy cream 
* ½ cup milk 
* 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan

### Method

* Set the oven at 400 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Butter a shallow 2-quart baking dish.
* Place the pumpkin cut side down on the baking sheet. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until it is tender when tested with a knife (it should not be falling apart). Remove the pumpkin from the oven and turn the halves seed side up to cool.
* Turn the oven down to 350 degrees.
* Scoop out the seeds from the pumpkin. Set it flat sides down on a cutting board and slice into 1-inch wide strips. With a paring knife, remove the peel. 
* Arrange the slices in the baking dish in one layer. Sprinkle generously with salt. With a tea strainer, sift the flour over the slices. Sprinkle with thyme and pepper.
* In a bowl, beat the egg. Stir in the cream, milk, a generous pinch of salt, the 1 cup Parmesan. Pour it over the pumpkin slices. Sprinkle with more Parmesan. Set the dish on a baking sheet. Bake for 35 minutes or until brown and bubbly. Cool for a few minutes before serving.
