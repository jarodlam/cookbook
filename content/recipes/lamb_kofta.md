### Ingredients

* 1 garlic clove
* Handful each of fresh parsley, coriander and mint
* 50g red onion
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tin of lentils (rinsed and drained)
* 25g TMX stock paste
* 500g lamb mince

### Method - Marinade

* Add garlic, onion and herbs to the bowl and blitz on Speed 7 for 3 seconds.  
* Add remaining ingredients and mix on Reverse Speed 4 for 20 seconds using the spatula to help move it around in the bowl.
* Roll into small balls (I made about 24) and bake in the oven on a tray lined with baking paper at 200deg for approx. 20 minutes.
* Serve with tortillas and vegetables.
* A great dressing is plain yoghurt with chopped mint, lemon juice and salt/pepper to taste.
