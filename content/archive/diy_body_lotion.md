### Trial 1 (17/05/15) - Aloe Vera Lotion

* 1 1/2 tablespoons shea butter
* 8 tablespoons jojoba oil
* 2 tablespoons grated beeswax
* 1 cup (250ml) of aloe vera gel (about the same temperature as the oil-beeswax combo)
* 1 tsp Vitamin E
* 3 tsp glycerine
* 8 drops (or more) lemon essential Oils

### Method

* Melt butter, oil & beewax in a double boiler.
* Let the mixture cool to room temperature.
* Combine Vitamin E & essential oil in aloe vera gel.
* Use a mixer, gradually blend aloe vera gel mixture with oil-wax mixture.
* Add glycerine towards the end.

### Trial 2 (31/05/15) - Water-based Lotion

* 1 1/2 tablespoons cocoa butter
* 8 tablespoons jojoba oil
* 2 tablespoons grated beeswax
* 1 cup (250ml) of distilled water (about the same temperature as the oil-beeswax combo)
* 1 tsp Vitamin E
* 3 tsp glycerine

### General Ratios

* 1 part oil
* 2 parts water (or rose water, green tea, or aloe-vera gel)
* 1/4 part beeswax
* To this, you can also add:
* a few drops of essential oil or oils of your choice – add them to the water prior to incorporating
* 1/8 to 1/4 part cocoa or shea butter, if using

### Jojoba, Cocoa and Avocado Lotion

### Ingredients

* 1 1/2 tablespoons cocoa butter (due to the firm consistency, you’ll need to scrape it out of the container with a spoon)
* 2 tablespoons jojoba oil
* 1/4 cups + 2 tablespoons avocado oil
* 2 tablespoons grated beeswax
* 1 cup of water (about the same temperature as the oil-beeswax combo)

### Method

* Heat the oils, cocoa butter, and beeswax together either in a double boiler or a microwave (you will need to microwave it on high for about a minute and a half), until the mixture is completely liquid, with no solid particles remaining.
* Transfer the mixture into a mason jar where you intend to make and keep your lotion, and allow it to cool until warm – but not all the way to room temperature.
* Begin to blend the mixture with an immersion blender while slowly pouring in the warm water (be sure that you water and oil are about the same temperature to prevent the separation). Continue to blend and watch it transform into a thick, white lotion we all know and love.
* For clean-up, use a paper towel to wipe down the blender attachment prior to washing it in hot water and dish-washing soap.
* Your lotion will keep for at least a month in refrigerator.

### Notes

* Add 1 tsp of vitamin E.
* Cocoa butter is especially amazing because of its rich, decadent chocolate aroma, and cocoa-butter-based lotion needs no additional fragrances.
* Shea butter on the other hand is completely odorless, which makes it a great candidate for when you want a fragrance-free lotion, or if you wish to scent it with an essential oil which would otherwise clash with the cocoa scent. If you want your lotion to smell like pure lavender, for instance, shea butter is the way to go.

### Glycerin or honey

* Both glycerin and honey are humectants, which is the name for substances that help retain moisture. Adding a bit of glycerin to a lotion gives it a pleasantly slippery feel, but be careful not to add too much or your lotion will feel sticky. A little squirt is all you need.
* Glycerin can be either vegetable (i.e. plant-derived) or the regular kind (made from animal or petroleum-based oils, as far as I understand). Regular glycerin can be found at drug stores and vegetable glycerin is often sold in food co-ops and such.

### Aloe Vera Gel

* You can also substitute the water in the recipe with bottled aloe vera gel, which will make your lotion really smooth and slippery like store brands. By contrast, lotions made with plain water will feel more like body butters.

### Oatmeal Water

* Boil NON-instant rolled oats in water for a ten minutes, allow to cool, strain out the water, and use it in place of regular water in your lotion. Another way to get a nice, slippery lotion!

### Green Tea

* Substitute green tea for the water in the recipe.

### Essential Oils

* If you wish to use your favorite essential oils, add a few drops to the water prior to mixing it with the melted wax-and-oil combo. I am wild and crazy about lavender, for instance, and make at least some lavender lotion on a regular basis.

### Water

* Water does not need to be distilled.  Personally, I just use my regular hard water from the well on my farm – the same water we drink every day – and it works just fine. If you only have unfiltered, chlorinated city water, you may wanna go with distilled water instead.

### Beeswax

* Beeswax! It will need to be grated. I use my regular hand grater, which I afterwards wash in hot water and dawn while helping myself along with a metal scrubber. But, again, beeswax is edible, so any residue shouldn’t be a problem.

### I've tried making lotion before but it later separated. What gives?

* Your water and oil-beeswax mixture need to be about the same temperature as you are combining them.
