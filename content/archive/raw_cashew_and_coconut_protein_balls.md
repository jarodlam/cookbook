### Ingredients

* 1 cup cashews
* 2 tbsp protein powder (I used vanilla soy protein which is dairy-free)
* Â¼ cup shredded coconut
* 1 tbsp chia seeds
* 2 tbsp honey
* 10-12 pitted dates

### Method

* Place cashews in your food processor and blend into fine crumbs.
* Add in protein powder, coconut and chia seeds and process until combined.
* Combine honey and dates in your processor and blend until it can form a soft ball.
* If the mixture still remains crumbly, add a teaspoon of water at a time until it comes together.
* For easy portioning, use an ice cream scoop to create 6 large balls, then halve each and roll into 12 little balls.
* I store mine in zip locks bags in groups of 4, putting half in the freezer and keeping half in the fridge.
