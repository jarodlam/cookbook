### Ingredients

* 1 brown onion
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1-1.5kg fresh tomatoes chopped
* 30-50g balsamic vinegar
* 1 heaped tablespoon TMX stock
* handful of fresh herbs (or use dried) thyme, basil, sage, oregano
* 2 bay leaves
* salt to taste

### Method

* Add onion and garlic to bowl and chop on Speed 7 for 3 seconds.
* Add remaining ingredients and cook for 30 minutes at 100deg on Speed 1.
* Cook for a further 5 minutes at Varoma Temp on Speed 1 with basket on top and MC out.
* Blitz the mix on Speed 8 to your preferred consistency.  Pour into sterilised jars.
* This can be used in so many ways from pizza sauce, pasta sauces, meatloaf or just add to a casserole to give extra flavour.  Anything you would use a tin of tomatoes for you can use your homemade passata.
