### Filling Ingredients

* 1kg fresh pineapple,roughly chopped 
* 300g sugar 
* 1 cinnamon quill 
* 4 cloves 

### Pastry Ingredients

* 250 g plain flour 
* 1 egg, plus extra for brushing 
* 120g unsalted butter 
* pinch salt 

### Filing Method

* Place pineapple into TM bowl and chop 3 sec/speed 6. Drain juice completely.
* Add sugar, cinnamon quill and cloves into mixing bowl and cook 25 min/Varoma/speed 1. The jam should be firm, sticky and slightly brownish in colour. Set aside.

### Pastry Method

* Pre-heat oven to 180ºC. 
* Butter a mini 24 hole tart tin and set aside. (stage 4)
* Place all ingredients into TM bowl and mix 30 sec/speed 7.
* Turn out onto floured ThermoMat, push together and then roll out.
* Using MC, cut into rounds and line tin.

### Tip

* See your Everyday Cookbook for our Butter recipe.
* If the pastry becomes warm while you are working with it, it will tear easily. Place it back in the refrigerator,if required. Biscuits are fragile when hot.

### Variation

* To make the pineapple-shaped Pineapple tarts, follow above preparation up to stage 4, rolling out the pastry to 2 – 3mm thickness. Cut pastry using a cup or glass about 12cm in diameter. With the pastry circle flat on your fingers, place a 2cm ball of pineapple filling in the centre and curl your fingers inwards to make the pastry encase the filling.
* Make sure the pastry seam (opening) is on the bottom, press down on the pastry to flatten it slightly, then seal the ends and trim to make a small pineapple-shaped oval. Score the top of the tart with a sharp paring knife, 4- 5 diagonal lines in both directions for the ‘pineapple effect’ and brush the top with the egg wash. Bake and store as above.
