### Ingredients

* 500g chicken breast diced
* 2 spring onions
* 1 handful of fresh parsley
* 1 garlic clove
* 1 tin of chick peas rinsed and drained
* 100g breadcrumbs
* 50g EDC dukkah

### Method

* Add onions, parsley and garlic to the bowl and chop on Speed 7 for 3 seconds. 
* Add chicken and set to Closed Lid, press Turbo for 2 seconds, repeat.
* Add chick peas and again set to Closed Lid, press Turbo for 2 seconds, repeat until chick peas have been blitzed to your preferred consistency.
* In a separate bowl, mix breadcrumbs and dukkah.  Roll chicken into balls and cover in the breadcrumbs.
* You could bake in the oven but be careful of over baking and drying them out.  I preferred to fry in an electric frypan and once cooked keep temperature down low with lid on to retain moisture.
