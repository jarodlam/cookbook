base. Chop the peeled tomatoes into quarters.

* Add all other ingredients, including the apple and onion, and mix for 3 seconds, Reverse, Speed 4.
* Remove MC and place basket on top to prevent splashes.  Cook for 60 minutes, 100 degrees, Reverse, Speed 1-2.
* Increase temperature to Varoma, and cook for another 20 minutes, Reverse, Speed 1-2.
* Test the consistency of the chutney by spooning a tablespoon of it onto a dish, then place it in the fridge for 5 minutes. If it's still too runny, keep cooking at Varoma for 5-10 minutes and check again.
