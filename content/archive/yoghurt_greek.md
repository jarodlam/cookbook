### Ingredients

* 40g Raw sugar 
* 2 litres of whole milk 
* 1/2 cup Skim milk Powder
* 1/2 cup of Natural yoghurt ( I used George's Natural Yoghurt)

### Method

* Add Raw sugar to TM bowl.  Mill for 20 sec on speed 10.
* Add milk and milk powder.  Set TM to 80 degrees for 20mins on speed 2-3.
* Once finished, let it cool to 37° Do this by taking the lid off and removing the bowl from the TM. It can take an hour for the Temperature to drop. (Don't let it go below 37°)
* Add 1/2 cup of Natural yoghurt ( I used George's Natural Yoghurt)and mix on speed 4 for 10 seconds. Set to 37° and mix again for 20 min on speed 2 -3

* Refrigerate before serving.
