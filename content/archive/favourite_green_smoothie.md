### Ingredients

* 1 or 2 frozen bananas, quartered
* 2 apples, quartered (no need to peel or de-seed)
* 1 lime, peeled, include some peel
* 2 handfuls of ice
* 300g coconut water
* 2 or 3 big handfuls of fresh greens (kale, baby spinach, English spinach, cos or butter lettuce)

### Method

* Blend in the Thermomix on speed 10 for 2 minutes. (Note: I find 1.5mins is enough)
* Check texture – if it’s too thick, add some more water and re-blend briefly.

### Tip

* You can also add a tablespoon of a nutritious vege powder like Nutra Organics' Vital Veggie Power or Super Greens & Reds if you want an extra micronutrient boost!
