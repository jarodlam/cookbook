### Ingredients

## Roux

* 150g water
* 30g baker's flour

## Remaining dough

* 380g baker's flour
* 210g water
* 3 tsp dried yeast
* 2 tbsp powdered milk (optional)
* 1 tsp salt
* 40g sugar
* 30g oil or butter

### Method

* Place water and flour for the roux into TM bowl and cook for 3 minutes at 70°C on speed 3. (This process may take less than 3 minutes and should be watched closely. You are looking for a slightly thickened paste consistency.)
* Place remaining ingredients except oil or butter into TM bowl. Mix for 7 seconds on speed 6. It will be a very sticky dough.
* Add oil or butter and with dial set to closed lid position, knead for 5 minutes on interval speed.
* Remove dough from TM bowl and throw several times onto floured ThermoMat. (This will improve the texture.)
* When dough is elastic and very soft to the touch (and no longer sticky) wrap in ThermoMat and allow to double in size.
* Form into 60g rolls and arrange on lined and buttered tray. Allow to double in size again before putting into a cold oven. Bake for 20 minutes at 180°C. Cool slightly before serving.

### General Tips

* For a sweeter roll, add 80g honey instead of sugar and reduce salt by ½ tsp.
* For savoury rolls, add extra ½ tsp salt.
* Dough can be baked in a loaf tin.
