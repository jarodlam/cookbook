Bring a great big smile to Mum's face with this luscious,
chocolatey-everything delight. No cooking required!

### Ingredients

* 200g Arnottâ€™s Choc Ripple biscuits 
* 80g butter, melted
* 200g dark chocolate, chopped
* 2 Tbsp cocoa powder
* 60ml hazelnut-flavoured liqueur, such as Frangelico
* 150ml thickened cream, at room temperature 
* 300g cream cheese, at room temperature
* 150g caster sugar
* 200g extra dark chocolate, for decorating
* Extra cocoa powder, for dusting
* Whipped cream, to serve 

### Method

* Line a 20cm springform cake tin with baking paper.
* Put biscuits in a zip-lock bag and crush with a rolling pin, or process in a food processor until fine crumbs form. Put crumbs in a medium bowl with butter and stir to combine. Press crumb mixture firmly into tin and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
* Put chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, and stir gently until melted and smooth. Remove from heat. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes or until at room temperature.
* Combine cocoa powder and liqueur in a medium bowl. Add the melted chocolate and stir to combine.
* Meanwhile, whip cream until soft peaks form. Gently stir in chocolate mixture, in 2 batches, to combine. Set aside.
* Put cream cheese and sugar in a food processor. Process until blended, thenfold in chocolate cream and stir well to combine.
* Pour mixture onto biscuit base in tin and smooth the top. Freeze for 2 hours or until firm to touch.
* Line a large tray with baking paper. Put extra chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, and stir gently until melted and smooth. Pour chocolate into a small jug or use a spoon to drizzle chocolate onto prepared tray to form spoon-like shapes with long, thin handles. Freeze until hardened.
* Carefully remove chocolate decorations from paper and arrange on top of cheesecake. Dust with extra cocoa and serve immediately with whipped cream on the side.

### Notes

* Serve the cheesecake with a homemade coffee syrup. Bring three shots of espresso coffee and three tablespoons of sugar to the boil, then cool and serve.
