### Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil 
* 3 tablespoons of beeswax 
* 1 tablespoon of cocoa butter or shea butter 
* 1/2 tsp of vitamin E oil (or about 6 capsules) 
* 1 tsp of honey (optional) 
* 15 drops of peppermint essential oil  

### Recommended Equipment

* empty lip balm tubes (
* turkey baster, clean medicine dropper or disposable transfer pipette *small sauce pan
* glass measuring cup, large ceramic cup or large mixing bowl (glass or metal)
* grater (for the beeswax)
* Optional: square stick-on labels 

### Method

* First create a makeshift double boiler by filling a small sauce pan 1/2 way with water and turn the heat to low or medium low. Once the water is hot (barely a simmer), sit a larger sized bowl on top of the sauce pan to melt the lip balm ingredients in, or a large ceramic cup or glass measuring cup directly into the water. If you're putting it directly in the water, take care to use an oven mitt when handling it.
* While the water is warming up, carefully set all the empty lip balm tubes in an area close by and make sure the lids are removed. Once the mixture is melted you have to fill the containers quickly before it re-solidifies.
* Using a grater, shred 3 tablespoons worth of beeswax. If you're using the beeswax pastilles, you can skip this step. Place the beeswax into whatever container you're going to use to melt the mixture (measuring cup, mixing bowl, etc.), then measure in the olive oil and cocoa or shea butter.
* Place the container either over or directly in the water on low heat and wait for it to gently melt. Once it's completely melted (no beeswax solids remaining), turn off the heat and set the pan aside. Quickly add the vitamin E oil, honey, and essential oil (a little goes a long way), then give it one last stir.
* Using the transfer pipette or another form of dropper, carefully fill all the empty lip balm tubes with the mixture. If the mixture starts solidifying in the container, simply reheat it on low until it returns to liquid.
* When all the lip balm tubes are filled and the mixture used up, I recommend placing all the dishes/utensils you used in some hot water in the sink so that the beeswax doesn't solidify on them. It'll be easier to clean that way.
* Set the lip balm tubes aside and let them cool for 2-3 hours. Cap and use within a few months.

### Notes

* Homemade lip balm made with extra virgin olive oil, beeswax, cocoa butter, vitamin E oil, local honey, and 100% pure therapeutic-grade peppermint essential oil. This is an inexpensive DIY project you can make at home in about 15 minutes, and they make great gifts for guys and gals!
* If you're not a big fan of peppermint, try lavender essential oil (just for starters). 
* Citrus essential oils are popular for lip balms (lemon, orange, lime, grapefruit, etc.); however, they can increase photosensitivity (make it easier for your skin to burn in the sun), so be cautious of using them in your beauty products during the summer, or if you live in a sunny area.
