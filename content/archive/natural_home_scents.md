### Notes

* Add fragrance to your home using simmering waters infused with spices, herbs & fruit.

### Scent #1

* Oranges, cinnamon & cloves (allspice and anise are optional).
* This scent carries into multiple rooms better, and it can be reheated to scent your rooms for several days.

### Scent #2

* Lemon, rosemary, & vanilla.
* It has a lovely freshness to it. 

### Scent #3

* Lime, thyme, mint & vanilla extract. 
* This combination has such a fresh, pleasant scent. I initially made it without the mint extract, but have found that it really kicks up the aroma.

### Scent #4

* Orange, ginger (fresh or powdered), and almond extract. 
* This is a sweet, delicious scent.

### Scent #5

* Pine or cedar twigs (or other fragrant twigs), bay leaves, and nutmeg. 
* These scents combine for a complex aroma. If you have whole nutmeg, use a microplane to grate off the outer surface--this will release the scent. Add the whole nutmeg piece along with the gratings.

### How to heat the mixture

* Uncovered Slow Cooker Method. This is my personal favorite. I use a mini slow cooker--the kind made for keeping dips and sauces warm. Mine only has one low heat setting. The mixture never actually bubbles and visibly steams. I leave it uncovered on my kitchen counter to slowly release scent throughout the day. It's subtle, but creates a pleasant smell in my kitchen and a hint of scent in surrounding rooms. When I'm home, I keep my mini slow cooker going. It's easy and uses very little electricity. When I fill mine in the morning, it won't dry out for an entire day. If you're concerned about accidentally letting it run dry, you can put a lamp timer on it so that it automatically shuts off at the desired time. I put a scented jar mixture in the microwave for 2 minutes to get it really hot before I add it to the slow cooker. That gives it a jump start on releasing the scent.  
* NOTE: For a stronger scent, simply double or triple the recipe in a larger, full-size slow cooker and set it on high.
