### Ingredients

* 100 grams dried soya beans soaked in water overnight or at least 6 hours, (change the soaking water at least once and do a final rinse with fresh water
* 1 litre water
* 60 grams Chinese rock sugar or raw sugar
* 2-3 pandan leaves, (optional)

### Method

* Place drained beans and 500 grams of water into Closed lid and cook for 6 minutes at 80 degrees counter-clockwise operation on speed 1-2. Ensure that the beans are cooked at 80 degrees for at least 2 minutes.
* Blend for 1 minute on speed 8 until smooth and creamy.
* Add remaining water, pandan leaves and sugar and cook for 6 minutes at 90 degrees on speed 2-3. Towards the end of cooking, keep an eye on it to ensure that it doesn't boil over. 
* Cool, strain through a calico cloth or nut bag and serve warm or cold. This is meant to be drunk as a beverage but can also be used on cereal or as a milk substitute (in which case you may prefer to not add pandan leaves and sugar).

### Top

* I have used the other TM method for making soya milk, but always found that there was a slightly bitter aftertaste. I researched the reason why and discovered that the soy beans need to be cooked to approx 82 degrees before being blended to avoid the bitterness and 'beany' taste.
* By using this method, there is also less likelihood of the milk boiling or foaming over. If the milk does start to boil over, turn off for a few seconds and then on again. You need to complete the cooking process.
* If using organic soya beans there is no need to change the soaking water more than once.
* If you're not used to 'real' soya milk, you can make it taste more like the commercial stuff by adding vanilla, malt, oats or barley (during cooking process). I'm not sure in what quantities as I'm happy drinking the real, unalterated soya milk.
* The left over pulp is called okara and has several uses, but is quite bland and grainy. Use it in your worm farm or bokashi bucket.
