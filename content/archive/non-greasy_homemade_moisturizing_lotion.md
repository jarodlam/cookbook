### Ingredients

* 1 cup aloe vera gel
* 1 teaspoon vitamin E oil
* 3/4 ounce (21 g) beeswax, grated or broken into small pieces
* 1/2 cup almond or grapeseed oil
* 1 tablespoon cocoa butter (I added this for a slightly more luxurious lotion during the winter, but this is optional.)
* 10 drops essential oils of choice (optional)

### Method

* With a makeshift double boiler, over low heat, melt beeswax and oils.
* In a medium-sized bowl, combine aloe vera gel, vitamin E oil, and essential oils.
* Pour the melted oils into a blender and allow them to cool to room temperature. This is a vital step in order to prevent separation. Once cooled, with blender on low speed, slowly and continuously pour in aloe vera mixture. Run a rubber spatula against the sides of the blender to incorporate all ingredients. Blend until the mixture has the look and feel of lotion. Note: This step may also be performed in a mixing bowl with the use of a handheld electric mixer.  
* Pour the lotion into sterilized jars. You can use sterilized canning jars if you have them on hand. I keep a jar on the bathroom counter and one in the refrigerator. The lotion will keep for up to 6 weeks in the refrigerator.

### Notes

* Almond oil and grapeseed oil are readily absorbed by the skin thereby leaving the non-greasy feeling.
* My favorite essential oil combination for this lotion is geranium and lime!
* -This lotion is not only perfectly moisturizing for these winter months, but with the addition of aloe gel, I anticipate this recipe will carry me through the summer as well! I think itâ€™s going to be perfect for those after-to-much-sun days.
