### Tips

* Serve dusted icing sugar or with chocolate cing.
* This cake is best eaten cold as it almost sets when its is cooling to a fudgy interior and chewy sugary crust.

### Variation

* Use any flour you like.  Gluten-free flour is good for people who are sensitive to gluten and spelt contains extra protein.
