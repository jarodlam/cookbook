### Ingredients

* 500ml milk
* 250ml cream
* 1 garlic clove, half finely sliced, half left whole
* Pinch freshly grated nutmeg
* 140g gruyere, grated
*  Butter, for greasing
* Sea salt and freshly ground white pepper
* Chopped flat-leaf parsley, to serve

### Method

* Bring the milk and cream to the boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the sliced garlic, followed by the potatoes, nutmeg and a handful of the grated cheese. Stir well, then return to the heat and simmer until the potatoes have started to soften.
* Preheat the oven to 200°C. Rub the inside of a large baking dish with butter, then rub with the remaining half clove of garlic. Season the potato mixture to taste and spoon a layer into the dish. Sprinkle with some cheese and add more potatoes. Continue to layer until you have used up the potatoes, finishing with a layer of cheese. *Bake in the oven for 20–30 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp on top. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.
