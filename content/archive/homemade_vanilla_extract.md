### Ingredients

* 6-7 beans for a quart of vanilla (or just 2 for a half pint)
* Vodka to fill jar

### Method

* Split the beans lengthwise
* Then chop into 3-4 inch pieces
* Place the beans into your glass jar and fill to the top with vodka
* Steep 2 to 8 months (2 months should be fine for a pint, but the longer is sits the better it gets so no worries if you forget about it for a few months)

### Notes

* Glass jars or containers are ideal to avoid any possible chemicals leaching into your vanilla from the plastic. My favorite size is a quart mason jar. Half pint size canning jars are perfect for keeping smaller amounts handy in your spice cupboard. Or if you are feeling creative, watch your local thrift store for cute little glass jars (that’s where I got the one I’m using in the photos)
* You can reuse the beans after their initial steeping period, so don’t throw them away! Just remove the finished vanilla extract and refill the jar with fresh vodka. It might take a little longer the second time, but it will still work.
