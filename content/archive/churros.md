### Ingredients

* 190g plain flour sifted
* pinch salt
* 310g water (boiled)
* 160g butter
* 4 eggs
* Oil for frying
* 100g caster sugar
* 2 tsp cinnamon sugar

### Method

* Add sugar and cinnamon to bowl and mix on Speed 5 for 10 seconds.  Set aside on a plate ready for rolling the churros in.
* Add boiling water and butter to the bowl and mix for 1 minute at Varoma Speed 3 until butter has melted completely.  
* Add flour and salt and mix for 2 minutes at 100deg on Speed 3/4.  Scrape down sides and mix a little longer if required.  Allow the mix to cool to 60deg.
* Add eggs one at a time on Speed 4 beating well in between.  I took 1 minute 20 seconds to properly combine the eggs.  The mix will look glossy.  
* Spoon into a piping bag with 1cm fluted nozzle.
* I used grapeseed oil in a frypan to cook.  I put enough oil in the pan so that the churros were almost covered.  
* I cooked them in batches of 3, they don't take long and can be tricky to turn so didn't want to overload the pan and risk burning.  
* Once golden brown remove from pan and roll in the sugar.
* Serve on a platter with chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, fresh fruits, marshmallows etc.
