### Ingredients

* 250g cream
* 250g milk (I used skim/hilo)
* 200g sugar (this made it quite sweet so probably 150g would be enough)
* 1 tsp vanilla paste
* 2 egg yolks
* 2 ripe bananas
* caramel sauce (use your preferred favourite - I had some left over from making my cupcakes - Recipe here)

### Method

* Add all ingredients except caramel sauce to the bowl and cook for 7 minutes at 80deg Speed 4. 
* Pour into a tin and freeze overnight or until set.  
* Scoop into the TMX bowl and blitz on Speed 8 until it looks smooth and creamy.  
* With blades on Speed 2 slowly pour some caramel sauce through the MC.  
* Pour into a freezer container and return to freezer.
