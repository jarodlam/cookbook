### Ingredients

* 30g soy sauce
* 30g worcestershire sauce (homemade is awesome - recipe available at Stephberg.com)
* 1 large garlic clove
* 3 rosemary sprigs (leaves only)
* small handful of mint leaves
* 30g olive oil (optional)

### Method

* Put everything into the bowl and blitz on Speed 7 for 10 seconds.  
* Coat your leg of lamb in an oven bag and rub the marinade in. (score the top of the leg to get the flavour in)
* I generally cook my lamb slowly (approx 100deg) for a few hours then turn the heat up to 200deg an hour before I want it ready.  I'll be honest the temp of my oven will go up and down depending on if I am cooking other things at the same time but regardless my lamb always comes out perfect and falling off the bone.
* Pour the remaining juices into the TMX bowl along with approx 300-400g of water, 50g plain flour and beef stock or vegetable stock paste and cook for 7 minutes at 90deg Speed 4 for awesome gravy.
