### Ingredients

* 600g chicken diced

* 20g wholegrain mustard 
* 1/2 tablespoon Vegetable stock paste 
* 30g honey 
* 20g flour 
* 100g water 
* 150ml cream 
* 30g olive oil 
* 1 package puff pastry 
* 2 carrots 

### Method

* Put onion and carrot in TM bowl and chop for 5 seconds at Speed 7. 
* Add oil and saute for 2 minutes at speed 1 at 100'c.
* Add flour and stir for 3 seconds on speed 4.
* Add water and cook 1 minute at 70'c on Speed 1.

* Add cream and cook for 20 minutes, at 100'c on Reverse Speed and Soft Stir. 
* Spoon a portion of the mixture onto a puff pastry sheet and fold into a parcel. Do this for each parcel required leaving some of the mixture aside to use as a pour over sauce.
* Lightly brush the parcels with water and bake the parcels in the oven for approx 20 - 30 minutes until golden.
* When parcels are cooked, place onto a plate and drizzel the remaining mixture over the parcel. A small amount of water can be added if the mixture is too thick.

* Serve with salad or vegetables.

### Tip

* If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can add some cornflour and a little water paste and cook for further 2 minutes at 100'c,Reverse Speed and Soft Stir. 
* Sauce can also be eaten without baking into puff pastry with rice or vegetables.
