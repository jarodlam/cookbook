### Cauliflower Sauce, in bowl

* 1 onion, halved
* 2 garlic cloves
* 60g duck fat (or ghee/butter if you can have dairy)
* 800g cauliflower florets
* 150g leeks, white only, sliced
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 320g chicken broth (or water + 2 Tbspn chicken or vege stock paste)

pepper

### In Varoma

* 600g raw chicken, diced (or if using cooked chicken, add later)
* 200g pumpkin, thin slices, 1 cm pieces
* 200g peas
* 200g carrots, diced

### Pastry

* 300g almond meal (or a mixture of blanched almonds, sunflower, and pepita seeds, milled 10 sec/speed 8)*
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 30g duck fat or lard (or ghee if you're not dairy free)

### Methods

* Place all pastry ingredients into a bowl and mix 20 sec/speed 4. Remove from bowl, wrap in greaseproof paper, and chill until filling is ready.
* Place onion and garlic into bowl and chop 3 sec/speed 5. Add duck fat or ghee/butter and cook 3 mins/Varoma/speed 1.
* Add remaining cauliflower sauce ingredients into bowl, place Varoma dish on top and add vegetables. Poke a hole in the centre for the steam to get through.
* Place raw chicken on Varoma tray, spreading out evenly, then place in position with lid on top. (See below for pre-cooked chicken.)
* Cook 20 mins/Varoma/speed 1. Stir vegetables and break apart chicken with spatula, poke a hole for steam, and cook another 7 mins/Varoma/speed 1.
* Remove Varoma and place chicken and veges in a large mixing bowl. (If using pre-cooked chicken add now.)
* Blend cauliflower sauce 30 sec/speed 9. Add to bowl and mix through veges. Set aside.
* Roll out pastry to 2mm thick on a Thermomat or silicon mat, with a piece of baking paper on top of dough so it doesn't stick to the rolling pin.
* Cut circles to fit tops of ramekins with a blunt butter knife. (Cut gently on silicon mat - don't use a sharp knife!).
* Fill ramekins about 3/4 full with filling, and top with pastry circles. Place ramekins onto baking trays, and bake in 180C oven for approx 25 mins, or until browned.

### Notes

* I prefer to use activated nuts and seeds - soaked and dehydrated - as they are easier to digest. If using activated nuts and seeds for the pastry, and milling them yourself, you will only need about 250g as they are lighter than raw.
* You can make this NUT FREE by using all pepitas and sunflower seeds instead of almond meal.
* If you don't have time to make individual pies, you can pour the filling into a large, rectangular baking dish, roll out pastry into a rectangle to fit dish, place on top and bake 25-30 mins, until done.
