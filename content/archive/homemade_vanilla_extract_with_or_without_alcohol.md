### Ingredients

* 1 glass swing top or other tall bottle (more if you are making gifts) (where to find)
* 8 ounces vodka, rum or bourbon (vodka is traditional) OR 8 ounces food-grade glycerin (non-alcoholic version) 
* 3-5 whole vanilla beans per 8 ounces of liquid 

### Method

* Cut vanilla beans in half lengthwise with a sharp knife or kitchen scissors.
* Use a funnel to fill your bottle 3/4 full with alcohol or glycerin.

Add 3-5 whole vanilla beans to every cup of vodka, bourbon, rum or
glycerin.

* Top the bottle off with more alcohol or glycerine until the beans are submerged completely.
* Close the bottle tightly and allow the vanilla to sit in a cool dark place for at least 3-6 months (the longer the better).
* Decorate your bottle with your own label, raffia or ribbons. Keeps indefinitely.

### Notes

* The alcohol you choose does not have to be fancy or expensive at all. It is simply a solvent to extract the vanilla goodness. The alcohol will evaporate off when you cook or bake with your vanilla anyway.
