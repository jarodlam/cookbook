### Ingredients

* 2 tsp. coconut oil
* 2 1/4 tsp. beeswax (or candellila wax)
* 2 1/8 tsp. sweet almond oil
* 2/3 tsp. olive oil
* Small containers

### Method

* Pour a couple inches of water into a shallow saucepan. Place a heat-resistant glass measuring cup (such as Pyrex) in the saucepan and heat over medium heat. Add the coconut oil and beeswax together in the measuring cup; melt each. It should take two to six minutes for both to melt completely.
* In the microwave, heat olive oil until luke warm (cold olive oil will harden the beeswax).
* Combine melted coconut oil and beeswax with warmed olive oil. Add sweet almond oil and mix well.
* Pour mixture into small containers. Let harden. Yields 5-7 pots of lip balm
* Optional: To make a sweet lip balm, mix 1/16 tsp. of honey with other ingredients. Since honey is not soluble in oil or wax, make sure to stir until mixed well.

### Ingredients

* 1 part olive oil
* 2 parts beeswax
* 2 parts coconut oil
* 2 parts sweet almond oil

### Method

* In a double boiler (I use a ceramic bowl over a simmering pot of water), stir beeswax and coconut oil until completely melted (for each batch, I used 1 part = 1 teaspoon).  Remove from heat.  
* Immediately whisk in olive oil and then sweet almond oil.  
* Whisk in additives and quickly pour into pots or tubes – mixture cools quickly, but can be reheated over the simmering water if needed.
* I made just a couple batches of the beeswax balm – some of the additives I used included:  peppermint extract, powdered makeup for color, honey (just a drop), and beet juice.  
* The extract smelled great, the powdered makeup worked fine, the honey smelled bad and I couldn’t actually taste it.  
* The beet juice was an attempt for a completely all-natural balm – I pressed chunks of beet and added the juice into the olive oil before mixing with the balm mixture.  
* You can see the slight color variation this produced in the “can’t be beet lip balm.”
