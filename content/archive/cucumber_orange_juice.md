### Note

* Cucumber is another great addition to green juices. This is a great one for the kids, as it's sweet, not too thick, and doesn't taste too 'green'.

### Ingredients

* half a cucumber (peeled)
* 2 green apples (quartered)
* 1 orange (peeled)
* 1 lime (peeled)
* 1 frozen banana (quartered)
* 2 big handfuls of ice
* 2 big handfuls of cos lettuce
* 300g water
* 2 tsp of Vital Veggie Powder

### Method

* Blend on speed 10 for 2 minutes.

### Note

* Vital Veggie Powder is optional, but I love to add some to the kid's drinks for extra nutrients. It's made from organic carrot, mango, pumpkin, tomato, broccoli sprouts, barley grass, spirulina, alfalfa, psyllium husks and chlorella. Available from Nutra Organics.
