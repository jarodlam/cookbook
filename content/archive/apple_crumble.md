This warming fruit dessert is quick and easy to make. We don't like the
crumble topping to go soggy, so the apple layer is moist but not watery.
If you prefer, you can use brown sugar in the topping instead of white
sugar. We like to serve our crumble with vanilla ice cream, whipped
cream and/or custard.

### Ingredients

We use a 20ml tablespoon and 250ml measuring cup for all of our recipes.

* 4 medium apples (we used Granny Smith apples)
* 40ml (2 tablespoons) water
* 38g (2 tablespoons) sugar

Topping:

* 75g (1/2 cup) plain flour
* 60g (3 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon) caster sugar
* 60g (scant 1/2 cup) finely chopped pecans or almonds
* 60g butter, chopped

### Method

* Peel and core apples. Chop apples into eighths then cut each eighth in half. You should have about 450g of peeled, chopped apple.
* Place apple, water and sugar in a large saucepan; cover and bring to the boil. Reduce heat so that the mixture is rapidly simmering. Simmer for about 10-12 minutes, or until apples are just soft.
* Spoon cooked apple into a shallow ovenproof dish with a capacity of at least 1 litre (4 cups). We use a pie plate that measures 22.5cm across the top and 20cm across the bottom.
* Preheat oven to 190 degrees Celsius (170 degrees Celsius fan-forced).
* Mix flour, caster sugar and nuts together in a large bowl. Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour mixture until well combined.
* Sprinkle topping over apple.
* Bake for about 25 minutes, until topping is lightly browned. Serve hot or warm.
