### Ingredients

* 400 – 450 gram fresh cooked corn kernels., It is about five or six ears of sweet corn (you can use frozen kernels if you prefer, just cook it)
* 50 gram Butter, (1 Tablespoon)
* 50 gram flour, (1 Tablespoon)
* 500 gram milk, (2 Cups)
* 15-40 gram sugar, (to taste)
* salt and pepper to taste

### Method

* Cook or steam corn, and then cut kernels off the cobs.  Use a spoon to scrape the cobs to remove any remaining pulp.
* Place butter, flour, milk, sugar, salt and pepper into TM bowl and cook for 7 minutes/90degrees/speed 4.
* Add in half the corn, and blend for 15 seconds, speed 5-6.  This is to break up the kernels so you don’t have only whole corn in your mix.
* Switch to counter-clockwise operation, speed 3, and add the rest of the corn.  Mix until incorporated.
