### Ingredients

* 4 oz glass spray bottle (not plastic!)

Water

* 2 teaspoons aloe vera gel
* 30 drops total of one of the following essential oil combinations:

Lemon, lime, melaleuca, and lavender OR my DIY anti-bacterial blend OR
doTERRA's On Guard blend

* Optional: 8-10 drops of vitamin E oil

### Method

* Fill your glass bottle half-full with water
* Add aloe vera gel, vitamin E oil, and essential oils
* Fill any remaining space in bottle with water and shake well
* To use: spray liberally on hands and rub together
* Repeat as needed

### Notes

* I used the vitamin E oil since it is nourishing for skin. If you don’t have it, that’s OK.
* Why I chose the lemon/lime/lavender/melaleuca combination of oils: Lemon, lime, and melaleuca are fabulous for protecting against environmental threats. The lavender also has some of these properties, but I mostly added it to make it smell pretty.
* Be extra cautious adding “hot” oils, such as cinnamon or clove, to this recipe, especially if you are planning on using this blend on children.
