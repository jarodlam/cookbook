### Ingredients

* Meat and water from one young, Thai coconut
* 1 cup fresh pineapple, cubed
* 1 tablespoon cacao powder (UK friends can buy cacao powder here)
* 2 cups fresh baby spinach (or other leafy green)
* 3 to 4 ice cubes to chill (optional)

### Method

* Blend all ingredients in a blender until smooth.

### Notes

* Young coconuts contain up to 16 ounces of coconut water. I recommend that you make this smoothie with 8 ounces of coconut water and drink the rest while you blend. Adding more than 8 ounces of coconut water will make the the smoothie thinner.
