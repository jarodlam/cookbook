### Ingredients

* 1 cup granulated white sugar
* 1/4-1/3 cup oil: coconut oil, olive oil, sweet almond oil, apricot oil, avocado oil, or a combination
* Optional: 2-4 Tablespoons orange or grapefruit zest (for extra exfoliation)
* Optional: 2 Tablespoons vegetable glycerin (extra moisturizing)
* 10 drops peppermint essential oil
* 10-15 drops wild orange essential oil (lemon or grapefruit will also work- or any combination of these)

### Method

* Mix sugar, oil, zest, and vegetable glycerin (if using) together
* Depending on what type of oil you use, add more or less to make the sugar stick together, but not enough to float on top
* Gradually add essential oils until youâ€™ve reached the desired scent
* Store your sugar scrub in a glass container and feel free to decorate with ribbon, stickers, etc
* To Use: Rub a small amount on hands or body and rinse with warm water
