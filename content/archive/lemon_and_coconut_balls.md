### Ingredients

* zest of one lemon
* juice of two lemons
* 3 tbs maple syrup
* 75g (1 cup) almond meal
* 75g cocount oil, melted
* 100g (1 cup) desiccated coconut
* 5 medjool dates, pitted
* extra coconut for rolling ball in

### Method

* Peel the lemon zest off using a potato peeler.
* Place zest and coconut in Thermomix and whizz for 10 seconds at speed 8, scrape down and repeat until zest is completed blended into coconut.
* Add all the rest of the ingredients and blend 10 seconds at speed 6. Scrape down and repeat if necessary.
* The mixture is quite soft at this stage but will firm up as the coconut oil sets. If I have time, I let the mixture firm up for 15-20 minutes at this stage.
* Roll into small balls and cover in coconut, then keep in fridge.
