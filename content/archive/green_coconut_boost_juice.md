### Ingredients

* a couple of big handfuls of kale
* flesh of a young coconut
* coconut water (from young coconut)
* a frozen banana or two, quartered (depending how thick you like it)
* 1 lime (peeled)
* 2 teaspoons of mesquite powder
* 300g water
* a couple of handfuls of ice 

### Method

* Blend in the Thermomix on speed 10 for 2 minutes. (Note: I find 1.5mins is enough)
* Check texture – if it’s too thick, add some more water and re-blend briefly.

### Note about mesquite powder

* Mesquite powder is made from the bean pods of the mesquite tree, dried and ground up. It has been used as a staple food for centuries by Native Americans. It is a high protein meal that contains good quantities of calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron and zinc, and is rich in the amino acid lysine as well. Its low GI of 25 helps maintain stable blood sugar levels. It adds a sweet, nutty taste with a hint of caramel, and can be added to smoothies and other drinks, to jellies, and to baking (breads, pancakes, muffins, cakes and cookies). When used in baking, the mesquite bean powder/flour is used in combination with other flours – substitute ¼ cup-to-½ cup mesquite flour in each cup grain flour.
