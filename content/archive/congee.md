### Winnie's simplified version

-   Add 200g rice to TMX bowl and mill for 5 secs/sp 9.
-   Add a small piece of roughly chopped ginger. Mill again for 5
    secs/sp 9. Scrape down sides.
-   Add 1200ml water and cook for 12mins/100deg/reverse/speed 1 (MC
    off).
-   While rice is cooking, mix 350g mince with some seasoning (salt,
    pepper, soy sauce) & 1 egg. Beat well and keep in fridge.
-   Gradually add in marinaded mince. Give it a quick stir. Cook for a
    further 12mins/100deg/reverse/speed 1 (MC off).

### Note

This makes a fairly thick consistency congee. Can add another 200ml
water for a more runny consistency.

### Ingredients

* 250g minced pork
* 3 tbsp light soy sauce
* A few dashes of white pepper
* 200g rice (Any variety will do, I used long grain)
* 1 inch piece of ginger, peeled (I used a bit more than this, about 1.5 *inches)
* 3-4 garlic cloves, peeled
* 1 carrot, peeled and sliced into chunks
* 1200g water (you can use stock for a richer flavour too but I don’t think *it’s absolutely necessary)
* Handful goji berries (you can buy these at health food stores but they’re much cheaper at the Asian grocers)
* Handful spinach
* White pepper, soy sauce, sesame oil, fried garlic, fried shallots to taste (optional)

### Method

* Marinate the minced pork with the soy and pepper. Set aside for at least 20 minutes. I normally do this the day or morning before.
* Pop the rice in the TMX bowl and mill for 5 secs/speed 9.This is a LOUDDDD process, so if you have any infants around, put them somewhere else or be prepared to deal with them freaking out like I did!
* Set rice aside.
* Pop ginger, carrot chunks and garlic into the bowl and chop for 7 secs/speed 5 until finely minced.
* Add rice back into bowl, pour your water in and add in the goji berries, and cook for 12mins/100 degrees/reverse/speed 1 (MC off)
* Add in teaspoons of your mince, give the bowl a good stir, and cook for a further 12min/100/reverse/speed 1. Add your spinach in through the hole in the cover in the last 2 mins of cooking.
* Make sure your spinach is mixed in. The congee may appear a bit watery, but let it stand for a few minutes or so and it’ll thicken up.
