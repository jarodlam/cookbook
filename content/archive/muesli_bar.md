### Ingredients

* 1½ cups rolled oats (use quinoa flakes for a gluten free option)
* ⅓ cup activated sunflower seeds
* ⅓ cup activated pumpkin seeds
* ¼ cup sesame seeds
* 2 tbp chia seeds
* ⅓ cup coconut flakes
* ¼ cup chopped raw cashews (or nut of your choice)
* ½ cup rice malt syrup
* ¼ cup coconut oil
* ¼ cup boiling water
* Generous pinch of sea salt

### Method

* Preheat oven to 170°C and line a 20cm square tin with baking paper.
* Place dry ingredients into a medium bowl.
* In a microwavable container, melt the rice malt syrup and coconut oil together (I recommend 1 minute on medium high).
* Pour the liquid mixture onto the dry and mix well.
* Add in the boiling water and pinch of salt and stir until the ingredients are evenly combined.
* Pour the mixture into the lined tray and smooth out with the back of a spatula.
* Bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown.
* Let it cool on a rack for 10 minutes, before removing it and cutting into 12 bars.
* Store in an airtight container. I like to pop a few in a ziplock bag and freeze for later!
