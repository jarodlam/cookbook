### Ingredients

* 2 onions peeled and halved
* 2 garlic cloves
* 20g oil
* 30g balsamic vinegar
* 1 heaped tsp cumin powder
* 1 heaped tsp smoked paprika
* 1kg Gravy Beef diced
* 80g tomato paste
* 40g plain flour
* 50g Worcestershire sauce
* 30g balsamic vinegar
* 1 beef stock cube (or 1tbsp TMX Veg Stock)
* 200g water
* Salt and pepper to taste

-   NOTE: THE DOUBLE UP ON THE BALSAMIC VINEGAR IS NOT A MISTAKE ITS HOW
    I DO IT. AS ALWAYS THOUGH IT IS COMPLETELY OPTIONAL IF YOU ADD IN
    EXTRA OR NOT.

### Method

* Add onions and garlic to bowl and chop for 3 seconds on Speed 7.  
* Add oil and 30g balsamic vinegar and saut√© for 10 minutes at 100deg Speed 1.
* Add remaining ingredients and cook for 45 minutes at 100 deg on Reverse Speed 1.
* Cook again for 15 minutes at Varoma on Reverse Speed 1 (with basket in place if you need to reduce liquid).  Allow to cool for a few hours.
* This makes a one huge pie or 4 medium pies.  
* If you are using shortcrust pastry I would do a double batch from the EDC.  
* Roll out pastry and place in pie tray, add filling, cover with more pastry, brush with egg wash and bake in 180deg oven for 20-30 minutes.
