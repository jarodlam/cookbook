### Seasoning Ingredients

* 1 garlic clove, peeled
* 20g oil of choice
* 1 tbsp sweet/mild paprika
* 1 tsp onion powder
* ½ tsp salt
* pinch of pepper and cayenne

### Mash Ingredients

* 600g sweet potato, peeled, cut into small cubes
* 30g butter (optional)
* 30g cream (optional)
* ¼ salt

### Remaining Ingredients

* 800g liquid chicken stock (or 1 tbsp stock concentrate + 800 g water)
* 500-700g chicken breast, sliced in half length ways
* 400g vegetables of choice
* 2 tbsp corn flour or tapioca flour, dissolved in ¼ cup of water

### Method

* Add garlic clove to mixer bowl, chop for 2 sec/speed 9/MC on. Scrape bowl down.
* Add remaining seasoning ingredients and mix for 5 sec/speed 3/MC on. Set aside.
* Without washing the bowl, add the liquid stock and set the timer for 12 min/100 degrees/speed 3/MC on.
* While the stock is heating up, prepare your sweet potato and place it into the simmering basket. 
* Prepare your chicken by coating well in the reserved seasoning paste and placing in the deep steaming tray. 
* Prepare your veggies and place into the flat steaming tray.
* Put the simmering basket with the sweet potato into the mixer bowl and set the timer for 20 mins/steaming temperature/speed 4. 
* Put your steaming trays with the chicken and vegetables in place. You may need to turn your chicken over half way through. If you are feeling organised, clean your kitchen!
* When the chicken and vegetables are cooked, set aside in a thermal server to keep warm. Set the sweet potato to the side.
* Retain 500 grams of the liquid stock in the bowl and add your corn flour mixture, cook for 5 min/100 degrees/speed 2/MC off.
* When the gravy has thickened to your liking and seasoned to your tastes, remove it to a gravy boat to keep warm and without washing the bowl, put your mash ingredients, including the reserved sweet potato, into the bowl and blend for 10 sec/speed 5/MC on.
* Insert butterfly and whip for 20 sec/speed 3/MC on.
* Serve.

### Notes

* If you are using soft vegetables, like broccoli or zucchini, add it in the last 10 minutes of cooking time - they dont need the full 20.
