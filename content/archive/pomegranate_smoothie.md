### Ingredients

* 1 cup water
* 1/4 cup raw cashews or almonds
* 1 cup pomegranate seeds
* 1 tbl raw honey (or maple syrup or dates - or none if you think it is sweet enough!)

### Method

* Add the water and cashews to a high speed blender like the VITAMIX and mix for a minute until the cashews dissolve and you are left with a creamy cashew milk. 
* Add the pomegranate and honey to the blender and mix for a minute until all ingredients are well combined.
