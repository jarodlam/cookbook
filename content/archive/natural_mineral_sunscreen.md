### Ingredients

* 6 teaspoons (24g) Coconut Oil or shea butter
* 6 teaspoons (36g) Vegetable Glycerine
* 2 teaspoons (6g) Titanium Dioxide
* 2 teaspoons (6g) Zinc Oxide

### Method

* Measure out dry ingredients into a small mixing bowl and add the glycerine one teaspoon at a time while stirring until evenly combined. Titanium and zinc have a tendency to clump, so mix well. Add the coconut oil to the mixture and combine. This will make a thin sunscreen with lotion consistency. In hotter regions of Australia, coconut oil will be liquid most of the year and a thicker formula may be needed. For a thicker sunscreen with better durability, replace the coconut oil for shea butter.
