### Ingredients

* 1 Tbsp Cacao Powder
* 1 Tbsp Chia Seeds
* 2 Bananas (small)
* 1 Cup frozen mango
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup plain Cashew/Almond Milk

### Method

* Blend all ingredients in a blender until smooth.
* Serve with natural muesli.

### Notes

* The cacao powder gives this smoothie a nice flavor while adding a powerful punch of free radical fighting antioxidants, energizing iron, and heart-healthy magnesium. The bananas are a good source of vitamin B6, vitamin C, potassium, and dietary fiber. Strawberries contain vitamin K, magnesium, manganese, copper, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, folate, vitamin B6, potassium and vitamins B2 and B5. Just be sure that you are selecting organic strawberries because they are one of the most heavily pesticide-sprayed fruits.
