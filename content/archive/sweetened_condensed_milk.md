### Note

-   This is equivalent to one 395g can of condensed milk

.

### Ingredients

* 125 g water
* 225 g sugar
* 110 g powdered milk
* 1 pinch salt

### Method

* Measure ingredients into TM bowl. 3 min / 100 degrees / speed 4.
* After removing from bowl, you will need to wash the bowl using hot water.
* The mixture will be thin, but thickens on cooling.
* The mixture can be measured and used immediately in any recipe calling for sweetened condensed milk.

### Tips

* Sweetened condensed milk can be made with 100% full cream powdered milk, 100% skim powdered milk, or a mixture of the two - depending upon whether you want the result to be full cream or reduced fat. The full cream version is 7-8% fat.
* Can be made from white sugar or raw sugar. Raw sugar makes a darker sweetened condensed milk.
* Salt is added to intensify sweetness.
* Can alternatively be made using boiling water from a jug                     - 1 min / speed 4. It is, however, easier to heat the water in the TM as in the "preparation" instructions above.
* Keeps for 2 weeks in fridge. Can be frozen.
