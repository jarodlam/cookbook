### Ingredients

* 80-100g raw dates, pitted
* 40g water
* 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
* 1/2 tsp bicarb soda
* 140g coconut oil (slightly melted)
* 200g almond meal
* 100g coconut flakes
* 100g macadamia nuts (or almonds, cashews, or other nuts)

### Method

* Preheat oven to 170 degrees Celcius, and line baking trays with baking paper.
* Place dates into Thermomix bowl and chop 10 sec/speed 8.
* Add water, salt and bicarb soda. Cook 2 mins/100C/speed 2.
* Add coconut oil. If oil is hard, melt mixture 1 min/37C/speed 2.
* Add almond meal, coconut flakes, and nuts into Thermomix bowl, and mix 10-15 sec/speed 5, or until desired texture.  (The mixture should be able to be pressed together with your hands, and not fall apart.)
* Form mixture into walnut sized balls and flatten (with your fingers) on greased or lined trays, to about 5mm in thickness. 
* Bake in moderate oven for 12 mins or until golden brown, then cool on the trays so they'll get nice and crisp.

### Variations

* If you like, you can use shredded coconut instead of flakes, butter instead of coconut oil if you don't need dairy free, and make them flatter for crunchy and thicker for soft and chewy. Dry dates will probably work as well.
