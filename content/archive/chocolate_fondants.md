* When ready, carefully remove fondants and discard baking paper. Dust with icing sugar and serve hot from the oven with ice cream and fresh strawberries.

### Tip

* To test if the fondants are cooked, press lightly on the top with your thumb, it should have formed a moist yet firm crust. Once you break into it, the middle will be a rich, chocolate liquid. 

* Serve with the creamy traditional ice cream from your Everyday Cookbook
