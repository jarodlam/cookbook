### Note

* This may sound a bit scary, but it really is deliciously refreshing!

### Ingredients

* 60g rapadura (or more if not adding stevia)
* 300g ice
* 2 limes (peeled)
* a big handful of organic parsley
* 1/2 tsp green stevia powder (opt)
* 300g water

### Method

* Grind up Rapadura for 20 sec speed 9.
* Add the rest of the ingredients and blend for 1 minute, speed 10.
* Add water or soda water to the 2 litre mark, or to taste. 

### Variations

* Use 1 orange and 1 lemon instead of the 2 limes. You can use 80-100g Rapadura instead of adding stevia powder.

### Note

* Recipe was adapted from Lemon & Parsley Juice in Thermomix Everyday Cookbook
