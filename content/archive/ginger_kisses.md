* Add the other half of the flour followed by the second half of the milk, fold into mixture until well combine.
* Place about 2 cups of mixture into a zip lock bag (try to get as much air out as possible) cut the end off and pipe approximately 3 cm blobs onto the baking paper approximately 4 cm apart. Repeat this process until all mixture is used up… about 144 single biscuits.
