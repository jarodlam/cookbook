This delicious and delicate chicken mousse is steamed in lettuce leaves
instead of pasta!

### Ingredients

* 170g chicken breast, sinews removed, diced 
* 30g egg white 
* 500g whipping cream 
* 1tsp good fine sea salt 
* frozen peas 300g + 100g boiling water
* carrots, peeled and cut in chunks, cooked in lightly salted water until tender 
* sea salt and pepper 
* cos lettuce leaves, 1 large leaf per serving

### Method - Chicken Mousse

* Chop the chicken 6 seconds/Speed 6. Scrape down the sides of the TM bowl. 
* Blend 6 seconds/Speed 6 gradually increasing to Speed 10. Scrape down the sides of the TM bowl. It should be a purée by now; repeat if necessary. 
* Add the egg whites. Mix 2 seconds/Speed 7. 
* Turn to Speed 4 and gradually add the (pre-weighed) cream through the hole in the TM lid over a period of about 10 seconds, followed by the salt. Note: the salt reacts with the protein in the chicken and egg white and firms the mousse. 
* Mix 5 seconds/Speed 4 increasing to Speed 10 until the cream whips up just enough to hold its own weight. Do not over mix. No need to pass through a sieve! Set aside and chill. 

### Method - Carrot Purée

* Cook the carrots in lightly salted water until soft. Drain and transfer to TM bowl. Add a touch of hot water and blend 20 minutes/Speed 6. Season to taste. 

### Method - Pea Purée

* Blend partly defrosted frozen peas and boiling water 10 to 15 seconds/Speed 6. Season to taste. 
* Blanch the lettuce leaves in boiling water (no salt!) for 1 second and refresh in iced water. Drain. *Spread each lettuce leaf flat on squares of silicone paper. Pipe a line of the chicken mousse onto a blanched lettuce leaf. Fold leaf around the mousse to create the "ravioli". The mousse should be totally encased. 
* To cook the ravioli, steam for 4 to 5 minutes in the Varoma (start the timing from fully steaming already). 
* Brush the cooked ravioli with melted butter. Trim the ends off and serve with the carrot and pea purées, sliced roasted chicken and some chicken cream sauce (chicken stock reduction/glaze with a little cream stirred in).
