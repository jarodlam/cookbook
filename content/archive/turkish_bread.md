### Ingredients

* 15g dried yeast
* 5g caster sugar
* 375g warm water (125g and 250g)
* 480g bakers flour (100g and 380g)
* 1 tsp salt
* 60g olive oil

### Method

* Add yeast, sugar and 125g water to the bowl and mix on Speed 3 for 10 seconds.
* Add 100g bakers flour and Knead (Wheat setting) for 1 minute.
* Leave in the bowl to prove for approx. 30 minutes.  How quickly it will rise will depend on the weather.  
* Add remaining ingredients to the bowl and Knead (Wheat setting) for 2 minutes.  Lightly oil a mixing bowl and put the dough into the bowl and cover with glad wrap.  Note:  Dough is very sticky.  Leave to prove for 30 minutes (or until doubled).
* Lay baking paper on a tray and form your dough into your preferred shape(s).  You can make 2 breads or 1.  Leave to rise again for approx. 30 minutes.
* Preheat oven to 220deg.
* Poke some dents into the bread (I used the end of a wooden spoon) and brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Place into a hot oven for 10-15 minutes or until golden.

### Note

* I did one on a baking tray and one on a preheated pizza stone.  The pizza stone works really well (dust with flour before putting dough on) but did make it tricky to transfer dough onto it for baking.
