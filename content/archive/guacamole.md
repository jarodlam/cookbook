### Ingredients

* 2 parts Avocado
* 1 part Sour cream
* Sweet chilli sauce to taste
* Salt and cracked pepper (optional)

### Method

* Mix avocado and sour cream.
* Top with sweet chilli sauce, just a thin film. Mix it in, taste it, if it tastes funny, e.g. sour just add more sauce until it's just right.
* Add salt and cracked pepper

### Notes

* I also like to puree the avocados as I don't really like the taste of them. If you like the avocado you can leave them a little courser if that makes sense.
