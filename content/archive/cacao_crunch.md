### Ingredients

* 1 egg white
* 100g caster sugar
* 45g grapeseed oil
* 2 tablespoon water
* ½ tsp vanilla bean paste
* 65g plain flour
* 15g cacao powder
* ¼ tsp bicarb soda
* ¼ tsp salt
* Choc bits

### Method

* Preheat oven to 160deg and line a lamington tray with baking paper.
* Insert butterfly and add egg white to bowl.  Mix on Speed 4 for 30 seconds then while still on Speed 4 slowly add the sugar and keep whipping until you get to 2 minutes.  *Then slowly add the oil, water and vanilla through the MC.  I premeasured all the ingredients so I could do all of the above without stopping the blades.  All up it took 3 minutes.
* Add flour, cacao, bicarb and salt and mix on Speed 5 for 10 seconds.  Scrape the sides and repeat.
* Spread onto your lamington tray taking it right to the edges then sprinkle the choc bits over the top.  Use as much or as little as you like.
* Bake for 15 minutes, remove from oven and using a pizza cutter score into squares.  
* Return to oven for a further 5 minutes then I turned the oven off and left in the oven with the door ajar until it cooled.
* Snap into the pieces.
