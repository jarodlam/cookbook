### Ingredients

* 1 c warm water ( note: needs double )
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 c instant mashed potatoes (powdered kind works better than the flake or pearl kind)
* 1 c rice flour
* 1 Tbsp cornstarch
* 1/4 tsp of baking powder
* Peanut or coconut oil for deep frying

### Instructions

* Dissolve the salt in the water, then add to dry ingredients.  Mix into stiff dough.
* Pass dough through pasta machine at the lowest setting (I’ve never been able to make these thin enough rolling by hand).
* Cut the flatten dough into 2” squares or use a sharp cookie cutter lightly greased with cooking spray to make different shapes. 
* In a heavy skillet or kettle, heat oil to 350-375F (175-190C). Flash fry chips 10-15 seconds until crisp.
* Oven method: preheat oven to 450F (232C), arrange chips on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper, spritz tops with cooking spray, place in top rack of oven and bake for 2-3 minutes until crisp.
* Alt: Mix cooked potatoes and rice in blender/food processor with the cornstarch, baking powder & salt to make the dough (you shouldn’t need any water).
