### Ingredients

* 2 litres milk
* 0.5 teaspoon rennet
* 50g salt

### Method - Setting Curds

* Heat milk on temp 37 for 10 mins on speed 1
* Mix rennet with 1 tbspn water (filtered or unchlorinated better), and add to milk. Stir for 1 min on speed 1
* Pour milk into ThermoServer and let it sit for 1 hour.
* Cut the curds into 2 cm strips both ways and at a 45 degree angle.
* Let the curds sit for another 10 minutes.

### Method - Curds

* At this point, we bring the curds back up to temperature and then drain them.  Transfer the curds & whey from the ThermoServer back into the TM bowl. Reheat on 37 for 30 mins on speed Gentle stir setting.
* Line the rice basket with the cheesecloth. Pour the curds & whey into the rice basket over a ThermoServer. You will need to keep the whey for later.
* Cover the curds with cheesecloth and place a heavy weight on top. You will need to sit the rice basket somewhere the whey being pressed out can drain away. Leave for 30 minutes, then turn out of the rice basket.
* Cut the curds into pieces. Pour the whey back into the TM and heat for 5 mins, 90 degrees, speed 1.
* Put the rice basket in the TM bowl and put the pieces of halloumi back into the rice basket. Cook for 30mins, speed Gentle stir setting, on 90deg. The halloumi will rise to the top when it is done.

### Method - Brine

* Pour off all but 250g of the whey. 
* Add 250g of boiling water and 50g salt and cook for 100, speed 1, for 5 minutes. Let it cool, then put cooked halloumi into a container and cover with brine.
* The brine is quite salty, as it's a preserving agent. If you prefer, you can cut back on the amount of salt -  I wouldn't go lower than about 20g, however.
* Keeps for 1-2 weeks in the refrigerator.
