### Ingredients

### Method

* Place 1L of boiling water in your bowl. (You can boil the water in your electric kettle, or simply heat till temp in Thermie).
* Oil your silicon moulds & crack an egg in each, season if you wish. Place in your basket, or varoma if you need more space.  8 minutes, varoma, speed 2.
