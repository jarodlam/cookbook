The Italian name, carbonara, comes from the word for coal. This dish is
believed to have been created by coal miners, or maybe it's the black
pepper on the pasta which resembles coal dust.

### Ingredients

* 100g piece parmesan cheese
* 4 baby (100g) brown onions
* 375g fettuccine
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 12 (240g) thin bacon rashers
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* 3 eggs, beaten lightly
* 3/4 cup (180ml) thickened light cream
* freshly ground black pepper

### Method

* Using a vegetable peeler, shave cheese thinly. Cut onions into wedges. Add fettuccine to large pan of boiling water, cook, uncovered, until just tender; drain.
* Meanwhile, heat half the oil in large pan, cook bacon, stirring, until bacon is crisp; remove from pan. Drain on absorbent paper. Add remaining oil, onion and garlic to same pan, cook stirring, until onion is soft.
* Return half the bacon to the pan with Combined eggs and cream, fettuccine and half of the cheese. Toss gently over low heat until fettuccine is coated with sauce. Serve pasta topped with remaining bacon, cheese and pepper. 

### Notes

* Not suitable to freeze.
* Bacon suitable to microwave.
* Recipe must be made just before serving.
