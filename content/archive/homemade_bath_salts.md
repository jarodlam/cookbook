### Ingredients

* Coarse sea salt
* Epsom salts
* Baking soda
* Essential oils
* Food coloring

### Method

* In a large bowl, mix to combine: 6 parts coarse sea salt; 3 parts epsom salts, to soothe tired muscles and reduce inflammation; and 1 part baking soda, to soften waters and alleviate skin irritation.
* Add a few drops of essential oils, and combine.
* Add a few drops of food coloring, until you achieve the desired shade. If you intend to present the bath salts as gifts, be sure to store them in a stoppered and labeled container to keep out moisture.
