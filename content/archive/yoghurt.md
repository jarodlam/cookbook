* I use the recipe from the Every Day Cookbook (EDC) – but I personally find that recipe quite “wordy” and very confusing for beginner yoghurt makers.  (I’m saying this from personal experience!)

### Ingredients

* 1 litre lite OR Full cream milk
* 50g Milk powder  (not essential – refer to Q&A on page 3 of this doc)
* 3 tbsp pot set Natural Yoghurt (this is your ‘starter’ – use a reputable brand of natural Greek Yoghurt for your first batch) eg: Jalna, Mundella, Farmers Union, Chris’s, Aldi/Woolies/Coles Greek yoghurt.

### Method

* Pour milk and powdered milk into TM bowl and blend for 10 seconds on speed 7.
* Cook for 30 minutes at 90 degrees on speed THREE (if cooked on speed 1 you will get a burnt film of milk on the bottom of your bowl – which does comes off quite easily after soaking using the Thermomix spatula) – however if cooked on speed 3 there is nothing left on the bottom!
* Place TM bowl into fridge for approx 40 mins to drop the temp down to 37 degrees. (put a timer on so you don’t forget!)
* Or somewhere cool but it will take a lot longer to cool down.
* When the 40 minutes is up – turn your Thermomix back on – place TM bowl on to unit and the temperature light should light up on the 37 or 50 degrees.  If it lights up on 50 degrees or higher – put bowl back in fridge for another 15 or so minutes.  Then take out and test again.
* The 37 degree temp is crucial for the yoghurt to be a success.  You need to wait for the 37 light to go OUT so you know it is no hotter than 37.  The bowl will be warm to your hands, but not hot, as 37 is normal body temperature.  If you accidentally forget it in the fridge and it gets way below 37 – don’t worry just put it back on to heat up again for say 5 mins, 37 degrees speed 3.  Once you see the light come on at 37 degrees you can then stop it.  (I say 5 minutes (number just picked out of my head) as you need to have a time set in order for the temperature to work).  (Remember the rule of TIME, TEMPERATURE, SPEED).
* Once at 37degrees add the 3 tbsp pot set natural yoghurt and mix for 4 seconds on speed 4.
* Cook for 10 minutes at 37 degrees on speed THREE – (if cooked on speed 1 you will get a burnt film of milk on the bottom of your bowl).
* At this time pre warm your Thermoserver with boiling water from the kettle.
* When the 10 minutes of cooking is finished – drain your water filled Thermoserver – then pour the cooked milk from the TM bowl into your pre-warmed Thermoserver.
* I then wrap my Thermoserver in a thick towel or blanket (baby blankets are great) to keep warm for a minimum of 6 hours (leave it somewhere in the house where it will be left undisturbed) – it can actually be left up to 24 hours!  (The longer you leave it the thicker it gets).
* After the minimum of 6 hours I then take the lid off the Thermoserver and Voila I have yoghurt!  I can honestly say it still NEVER ceases to amaze me the chemical reaction of what cooking milk and leaving it does – it still does my head in every single time!  Amazing!
* I then pour the yoghurt into a Tupperware container and also reserving 3 tablespoons into a smaller container to keep to use as my starter for my next batch.
* Trust me – Your yoghurt WILL get thicker and creamier the more frequently you make it using your own starter from each batch.
