### Ingredients

* 50 grams cornflour
* 100 grams white sugar
* 225 grams Butter cubed, cold
* 260 grams plain flour

### Method

* Preheat oven to 160 degrees.
* Place sugar into mixing bowl and mill for 10 seconds on speed 9.
* Add cornflour, plain flour and butter.  Mix for 10-15 seconds on speed 6. Mixture should appear crumbly. (Tip: this crumbly mixture is great as the topping on a fruit crumble)
* Knead 35-45 seconds, closed lid position/interval speed dough mode.  Mixture should come together to form into a soft dough.
* Turn out dough onto Thermomat and shape into a long square log.  Cut into 5mm slices.  (Shortbread can be pricked with a fork for decoration)
* Place evenly onto a baking tray (covered with baking paper).
* Bake in oven for 15-20 minutes until a light golden colour.

### Tip

* If you use Gluten Free flour, it makes an even lighter, shorter Shortbread.  And I thought I couldn't improve on this recipe.  I made this recently for my Gluten free friend and really enjoyed how yummy it was.  Try it!!!  You won't be disappointed.
