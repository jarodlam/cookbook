### Ingredients - Dough

* 400 g flour
* 250-300 g boiling water (this can vary depending on the flour)

### Method - Dough

* Place flour and water into the TM bowl, with dial set to closed lid position, knead for 1 to 2 minutes on Interval speed. The dough should be moist but not wet. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and allow to rest for approx 30 minutes.

### Ingredients - Filling

* 500g ground meat (pork or beef) or prawns
* 250g Bärlauch or wild garlic, washed and dried (alternatives: Chinese chives, Bok Choy, Wom Bok)
* 50g spring onions (cut in 3 cm pieces)
* 15g ginger
* 30g light soy sauce
* 40g sesame oil
* 50g white wine or sherry
* 5 to 10g salt
* white pepper

### Method - Filling

* Place half of the Bärlauch into the TM bowl and chop for 3 seconds on speed 6. Repeat with second batch, remove and set aside. 
* Add spring onions to the TM bowl and chop for 2 seconds on speed 6. 
* Add all ingredients to the TM bowl and mix on REVERSE speed for 30 to 60 seconds.

* To make the dumplings: Cut dough into 4 pieces. Work with one piece at a time, keeping the remaining pieces covered with a damp tea towel. Take the dough and form a sausage shape about 25 to 30 cm long. Cut it into approximately 2 cm pieces. Take one piece and flatten it with your palm, then roll into a circular shape. Repeat with all pieces. 
* Place a spoon of filling on the middle of the dough circle. Fold dough over and seal with small pleats.
* Place dumplings onto the Varoma tray, fill TM bowl with 900 g water, steam at Varoma temp, speed 1 for 15 minutes.

### Sauce

* I usually make a mixture of these ingredients (no measuring involved, just taste):
* Chinese vinegar
* Soy sauce
* pinch of sugar
* Chopped chilies
* Sesame oil
* Coriander
