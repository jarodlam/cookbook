### Method

* Choose a firm, small pie pumpkin, not more than 3-4 pounds; smaller pumpkins tend to be a bit sweeter.
* Rinse the pumpkin under warm water, removing any dirt or debris
* Cut the pumpkin in half on a large cutting board, with a sharp knife
* Scoop out the seeds with a metal spoon, I use an old measuring spoon that has a nice edge.
* Lay the pumpkin face side down in a large baking dish.
* Over with ¼ inch water.
* Bake at 180°C for 45-60 minutes (depending on size) or until tender, using a fork to check
* Remove from oven and scoop out insides, discarding skin.

Store in refrigerator in a glass mason jar

* Keeps for 5 days in refrigerator (at the ready for your pie, muffin and custard endeavors)

* If you are in a rush, cut the pumpkin into smaller pieces and it will cook faster. The pumpkin in the picture above was rather large (for a pie pumpkin) and I cooked it for 1 ½ hours. This was far too long (I became distracted during the endeavor) as you can see the pumpkin is rather overdone. However, I think it will still be usable for various dishes.
