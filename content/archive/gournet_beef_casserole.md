### Ingredients

* 1 kg chuck or blade steak - cut into 2cm cubes
* 1 tsp brown sugar
* 1 tbl flour
* 1 tbl TMX stock concentrate
* 1 tbl tomato paste
* pinch nutmeg
* 1 large onion
* 2 clove garlic
* 1 tbl malt vinegar
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 200g mushrooms
* 150ml dry red wine 
* 150ml water
* 1 tbl cornflour blended with small amount water

### Method

* Place onion and garlic in TMX chop 3 sec speed 5. 
* Add sugar, flour, stock concentrate, nutmeg, vinegar, tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce to bowl and mix speed 1 or 2 until combined (takes about 30 sec).
* Stir through meat and allow to marinate 1 hr - this stage could be skipped if short of time, however the dish is so full of flavour allowing to marinate.
* Add meat red wine and water to TMX - cook 50 mins, 100°, speed 1  counterclock.
* Add sliced mushrooms 15-20 mins before end cooking.
* Add blended cornflour and cook a further 5 -7 mins, 100°, speed 1  counterclock.
* Place in thermo server while veg cook.

* I cooked potatoes in steamer basket while carrots and broccoli cooked in the varoma.

### Tips

* I served this with mash, steamed carrots and broccoli.  However the recipe adapted from Best Recipes from the Weekly has a French bread stick cut into 2.5 cm slices spread with a combined mixture of 2 tsp french mustard and 15g butter. After cooking meat mixture in TMX, place slices on top casserole and push down gently to soak up some of the sauce.  Bake uncovered 20 mins moderate oven or until bread is browned.
