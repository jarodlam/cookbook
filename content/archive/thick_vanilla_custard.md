### Ingredients

* 50 grams cream
* 250 grams milk
* 2 eggs
* 50 grams custard powder, (or cornflour if you prefer)
* 60-100 grams sugar, to taste
* 1-2 teaspoons Vanilla Bean Paste

### Method

* Add all ingredients to bowl & cook 8 minutes, 90*, speed 4.
* If after 8 minutes your custard isn't thick cook for an extra few minutes. *I'm finding during winter the custard is taking longer to cook now.
