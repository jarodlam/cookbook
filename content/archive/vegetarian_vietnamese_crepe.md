### Ingredients

* 1 3/4 cups rice flour
* 1/4 cup wheat flour
* 1 to 1 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk
* 1 cup water
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tsp superfine sugar
* 2  scallions, thinly sliced into rings
* 2 tsp sea salt
* 2 tsp black peppercorns, freshly ground
* 1/2 tsp curry powder
* 8 Tbs  canola oil
* 1 cup dried mung beans
* 1 block tofu, firm
* 1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced
* 1 pack enoki mushrooms, cut in half
* 2 cups shitake mushrooms, sliced
* 2  shallots
* 4 cups fresh bean sprouts
* 1  Persian cucumber , sliced
* 1  lettuce
* 1/2 bunch fresh Thai basil
* 1/2 bunch fresh Asian mint
* 3 Tbs pickled garlic
* 6 dipping bowls nước chấm condiment
* 2 Tbs fresh red bird chili peppers, sliced

### Method

* In a bowl wash the mung beans thoroughly. Pick out and discard any bad-shaped beans and little stones then soak them for at least 3 hours before cooking. It's best to let the beans soak overnight.
* Place the mung beans in a sauce pan, cover with water and bring to a boil, then lower to medium low heat for 20 minutes. The beans should be soft and tender. Set aside.
* Cut the piece of tofu into 1/4 to 1/2 inch even slices. Pour the oil in a big pan, add the sliced serrano peppers and cook until they soften. Remove the pepper slices from the pan and set aside in a plate. The reason for cooking the serrano peper first is to provide a nice aroma to the oil. Pan fry the slices until slightly golden. Don't overcook the pieces or they'll start to get hard. Transfer all the tofu to a paper towel and let it cool down.
* Cut the pieces of tofu into very thin slices. Set aside on a plate.
* In another bowl, whisk the flours together with coconut milk and water. Add the turmeric, sugar, curry and scallions. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper. The flour should be stirred up well.  Make sure there are no lumps. Add 2 tablespoons of oil. Let the batter stand for at least 1 hour in a cool place.
* You can keep the batter in the refrigerator up 2-3 days.
* In a fry pan or a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat.  Add the slices of onions and shallots, the shredded tofu, the slices of shitake mushrooms and the enoki mushrooms. Stir fry for about 2 -3 minutes. Salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate. Set aside.
* Stir the rice flour batter and ladle 1/3 cup of it into the pan. Tilt the pan to distribute the batter evenly. Keep the heat high. Cover when the edges start to dry a little, and cook until the sides of the crepe turn deep brown and curl up, about 3-4 minutes.
* Spoon some mung beans and the mushroom mixture and place a few bean sprouts onto the banh xeo. Cover for another couple of minutes. Fold it in half using a wide spatula and slide it onto a warm plate. 
* Wipe pan clean with a paper towl and repeat the same procedure. Pour a little more oil into the pan before beginning the next crepe. 
* Serve the banh xeo with a nước chấm sauce on the side. You can eat it wrapped in lettuce filled with basil and mint or just simply plain.

### Tips

* You can make a meat version by adding sauteed shrimp and beef loin.
