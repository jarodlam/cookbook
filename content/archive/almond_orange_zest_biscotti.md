### Ingredients

* ½ cup butter
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 3 whole eggs
* 1 egg white, beaten (optional)
* 1 orange, peel grated, or as explained in recipe
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 3 cups flour
* 2 cups whole bark on almonds, toasted
* 2 tablespoons or more of sparkling sugar (or Demerera)

### Method

* Prepare orange peel: 1)peel orange without any pith; 2) slice peels into slivers or threads of peeling;3) place in small bowl.
* Place butter in large bowl of electric mixer, whisk at medium speed adding 1 cup sugar until thick and frothy and sugar is dissolved
* Beat in eggs and vanilla extract
* Sift flour, salt and baking powder together
* Remove bowl from electric mixer and using a wooden spoon, add almonds to the wet mixture until combined
* Add flour; combine until well mixed and form into a ball
* Divide dough in half and shape into 2 loaf like logs, or
* Divide dough into four equal pieces for smaller cookies, and shape into 4 even logs (Mine weighed 360g per log)
* Place each log on parchment covered cookie sheet; gently flatten each with palm of your hand
* Whisk egg white; brush loaves with egg white; sprinkle each with sparkling sugar (optional: we like it just as well without)
* Bake at 350 F for 20 to 25 minutes; watch that they don’t brown too much as they will be baked again
* Remove from oven; do not remove from cookie sheets until the loaves are completely cool as they are very delicate and will break
* Adjust oven temperature to 325 F
* Once cooled, carefully place loaves on cutting board and cut into ½ inch slices or as thick as you would prefer with a very sharp knife
* Place slices on cookie sheet standing up, as in photo above (not on a side); bake at 325 F for 7 minutes, turn sheets around in oven and bake 7 more minutes, ensuring cookies do not brown further (tin foil on top, if necessary)
* Remove to a wire rack and let cool.

### Notes

* To toast the almonds: I dry toast them in a frying pan, on medium high, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until nicely toasted
* For pistachio cranberry biscotti, use 2 cups pistachios and 1 cup dried cranberries
* For chocolate biscotti substitute 1 cup cocoa for 1 cup of flour
* For hazelnut chocolate biscotti, use 2 cups hazelnuts, and dip half in chocolate
* For a different topping, sprinkle logs with sliced bark-on almonds
* We prefer the traditional almond orange flavours, but adding a little almond extract is nice, too.
