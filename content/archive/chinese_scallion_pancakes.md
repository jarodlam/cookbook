### Ingredients - Dough

* 400g plain flour
* 230g water

### Method - Dough

* Place ingredients into TM bowl and mix on speed 5 for 10 seconds.
* Knead for one minute with the dial set to closed lid position on interval speed. 
* Let the dough rest for half an hour while covered.

### Note-

* If you have left over dough from making dumplings (recipe found here), you can use it for the spring onions pancake.

### Ingredients - Topping

* Salt (I use pink Himalayan pink salt from Costco)
* 4 spring onions, finely chopped
* Rice bran oil

### Assembly Method

* Cut the dough into six pieces (or more or less depending on how big you want your pancakes or how big your pan is)
* Roll the dough out as thin as possible, brush a bit of oil onto the dough, sprinkle some salt and spring onions.  This is a salty pancake so ensure most of the surface has some salt on it.
* Roll the spiral again according to the size of your pan (I do mine to about 20cm in diameter).  Doing this ensures there are lots of flaky layers to your pancake.  There may be holes in your pancake but that is perfectly normal
* Add 1-2tsp of oil onto the frying pan ( low heat- mid heat depending on your stove) the fry until golden brown.  Flip it over to cook the other side.
* Place the pancake onto the paper towel and cut the pancake into bite size pieces or tear it with your fingers.
* Serve hot... but I promise you it won't last long on the plate!
