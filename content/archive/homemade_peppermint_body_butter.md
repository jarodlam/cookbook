### Ingredients

* 6 oz Coconut Oil
* 2 oz Cocoa Butter
* Peppermint Essential Oil (or fragrance of your choice)– use therapeutic grade oils if you can.  They are safe for topical use.
* Red colorant (optional)
* Rubbing Alcohol (optional)

### Method

* Spray a storage container with rubbing alcohol and set aside to dry. (This will just sanitize your jars and is an optional step).
* In a double boiler, melt both the coconut oil and cocoa butter.  Once oils are melted, remove from heat and refrigerate. {Do not place in freezer!}
* Once the oils appear opaque, remove from fridge and using a stand or hand mixer whip. The oils will get creamy fast.
* Once oils are creamy, refrigerate for 5 minutes, and then continue to whip again.  Add in essential oils, and whip until you get stiff peaks.
* Separate into two bowls, and colour one with the red colorant. Using a spoon or piping bag, add a layer of white body butter, then red, alternating until container is full.

### Notes

* You can skip the colouring and just keep this white and it will still look really pretty.
* Some other fragrance ideas would be cinnamon, lavender, citrus, vanilla, coconut, eucalyptus… the possibilities are endless!
