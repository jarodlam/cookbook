### Ingredients

* 130g apricot oil
* 260g macadamia oil
* 50g beeswax pellets or a block of beeswax chopped up in small pieces
* 2 Tbspns rosewater or orange flower water (available from Chemists - although grocery store rose water essence will work too)
* 4 Tbspns distilled or boiled water
* 1/4 to 1/2 tsp lavender or rose essential oil; or orange essential oil if using orange water
* 1 Vitamin E capsule (squeezed out)

### Method

* Weigh oils and beeswax into the Thermomix bowl and cook for 15 minutes at 60C, speed 2, or until all the beeswax is melted.
* Add rosewater,distilled water, essential oils, Vit E capsule and mix on speed 6 for 3 minutes, scraping down halfway through.
* Pour into clean pots or jars straight away, while still warm. 

### Note

* You can buy beeswax as pellets, blocks, sheets or candles - just chop it up roughly if you don't have pellets, then chop it finer in the Thermomix before adding the oils. The good thing about using a block of beeswax is it's usually more pure. Do not subsititute paraffin wax.

### Variations

* Use any mixture of macadamia, apricot, avocado and almond oil for the base oils.
* Use orange flower water instead of rose water, with orange or bergamot essential oil.
* Omit essential oil and filtered water, and use 6 Tbspns rose water or orange flower water instead.
* Omit flower waters, use 6 Tbspns filtered water and 1/2 tsp essential oil of choice (or a little more if needed).
