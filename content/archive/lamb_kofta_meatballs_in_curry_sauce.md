* 1 medium onion, coarsely grated
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 25g (1/3 cup) fresh white breadcrumbs
* finely grated zest 1 lemon
* 3 tablespoons chopped coriander
* 3 tablespoons chopped mint, plus extra handful, to serve

### Method

* Place the mince, onion, garlic, breadcrumbs, lemon zest, coriander and mint in a large mixing bowl. Add plenty sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and combine thoroughly. Rinse your hands under cold water and, without drying, shape the mixture into 24 small meatballs.
* Place a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, and when. hot, add half the meatballs and fry for 4-5 minutes, turning often, until lightly browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate and repeat with more oil and remaining kofta.
* Return the pan to the heat, add the remaining oil, curry paste and ginger. Tip the tomatoes and coconut milk into the pan and stir well. Add the cinnamon stick and season with a little sea salt and plenty of black pepper. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 3 minutes.
* Return the kofta to the plan and cook in the curry sauce for a further 5 minutes, until tender and cooked through. Serve scattered with the red onion slices, mint leaves and naan bread.
