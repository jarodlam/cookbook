### Ingredients

* 370 g water
* 1.5 tsp Sugar (optional)
* 2 tsp dried instant yeast
* 620g white bakers flour
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 tsp bread improver (optional but helps to produce a fluffy loaf)
* 1 tbsp oil

### Method

* ADD ALL INGREDIENTS TO THE BOWL IN THE ORDER LISTED. COMBINE 15 SECONDS, SPEED 3. THEN KNEAD 6 MINUTES (DOUGH FUNCTION).
* NOW LET YOUR DOUGH REST FOR 15 MINUTES. YOU CAN LEAVE IT IN THE THERMOMIX BOWL, IN AN OILED BOWL COVERED, OR A THERMOMAT.
* PLACE YOUR DOUGH ON AN OILED BENCH & KNOCK DOWN (PUNCH TILL YOU RELEASE ALL THE GAS/AIR FROM THE DOUGH).
* ROLLS – DIVIDE THE DOUGH INTO 12 X 80G LOTS, ROLL INTO NICELY SHAPED BALLS & PLACE ON AN OILED TRAY NICELY SPACED APART. BREAD – PLACE YOUR WHOLE DOUGH INTO A JUMBO TIN AND SQUISH DOWN TO COVER THE BOTTOM OF THE TIN
* PLACE IN A WARM PLACE & TO PROVE. ROLLS – TILL ATLEAST DOUBLED IN SIZE. LOAF - UNTIL YOUR DOUGH REACHES THE TOP OF THE 900G JUMBO TIN.
* BAKE IN A PREHEATED OVEN ON 180◦. ROLLS – 15/20 MINUTES OR UNTIL GOLDEN BROWN. LOAF - 25 MINUTES OR UNTIL GOLDEN BROWN. TIP OUT OF TIN IMMEDIATELY TO COOL.

### Tip

* This is a versatile dough. You can use it for scrolls, pizza bases, twist loaves, cheese & bacon rolls etc.
* I find the fastest way to prove, is in your oven with a tray of boiling water. Close your oven door and leave it switched off. The steamy environment will make your dough prove very fast! 
* For cheese & bacon rolls pop your toppings on AFTER proving (just before baking). A little trick is to cut a slit over the top of the roll before proving so it makes a little 'seat' for your toppings to sit on.
