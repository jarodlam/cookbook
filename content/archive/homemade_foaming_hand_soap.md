### Ingredients

* 2 T Castille Soap
* 2 t Coconut Oil, Fractionated
* 5 drops melaleuca essential oil
* 5-10 drops other essential oil for fragrance (optional)

water

* foaming hand soap dispenser

### Method

* Add castile soap, coconut oil and essential oils to a foaming hand soap dispenser. It’s important to use a foaming dispenser, since the dispenser is what creates the actual foam. They’re kind of pricy online, so just use an old empty one, or ask your neighbor for their used ones. I guess you could always go dumpster diving, but that’s probably not first choice. Gently swirl ingredients together. You can see below how far the non-water ingredients come up on the bottle I used.
* Add water to the top of the bottle and twist on the lid. Gently swirl ingredients together again. I pulled the label sticker off of my empty dispenser. It came off really easily.
* And that’s it. Push the dispenser a few times and just like magic, homemade foaming hand soap appears! 
* The fractionated coconut oil provides some moisturizing benefit and the melaleuca oil is naturally anti bacterial. I chose Citrus Bliss essential blend as my fragrance because I love citrusy scents for my hand soaps.
* Honestly, you could even bag the essential oils and coconut oil and go with just the castile soap and water. It would still foam just fine and come out even cheaper. You can even buy already scented castile soap. My hands get super dry and I love to shake up the scent of mine every once in a while, so that’s why I use the coconut and essential oils.
* Also, sometimes I find my ingredients have separated, so a quick swish around and it’s good to go again.
