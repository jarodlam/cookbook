### Ingredients

* 1 litre full cream milk
* 200 grams sugar
* 600 ml Cream
* mix-ins- toppings/ flavourings of your choice

### Method

* Add milk & sugar to bowl. Cook 45 minutes, 100*, speed 3, MC OFF.
* Keep cooking in extra 10 minutes increments until your condensed milk has decreased to roughly 400mls (underneath the 500ml marker on your bowl). This doesn't need to be exact.
* Now pop your bowl into the fridge to chill.
* Once your condensed milk is cold insert your butterfly & add cream. Whip for 2 minutes, speed 3.

* You may now add your mix-ins. Mix for a few seconds, speed 3 to incorporate.
* Pour into your ice cream container and sprinkle with toppings. Freeze until set.

### Tip

* PLEASE NOTE: If you have time & would like a smoother icecream, after step 4 pour into ice cube trays and freeze for a while. Take out & churn in your mixer before adding your 'mix-ins' and refreezing.PICTURED: honeycomb & blackforest ice-cream. I simply added chopped honeycomb & sprinkled blackforest dukkah over the top.
