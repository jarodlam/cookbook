### Sauce Ingredients

* 2 cloves garlic
* 80g tomato sauce
* 60g apple cider vinegar
* 30g butter, ghee or oil
* 2 tsp seeded or Dijon mustard
* 2 Tbspns Tamari
* 2 Tbspns lemon juice
* 20g Rapadura or 15g honey
* 1 tsp herb salt
* 1-2 tsp chilli powder
* 2 tsp smoked paprika

### Other Ingredients

* 1 kg chicken thighs, fat removed
* 900g water
* 400g basmati rice or 350g quinoa (rinsed) or fill basket with thinly sliced potatoes(skin on)

### Sliced Vegetables

* carrots
* broccoli
* green beans
* red capsicum
* frozen peas and corn if you're in a hurry

### Method

* Mince garlic in Thermomix bowl on speed 7 for 3 seconds.
* Add remaining sauce ingredients and mix on speed 5 for 10 seconds.
* Pour over chicken thighs in a bowl and marinate for half an hour. (If you don't have time you can just go ahead and cook them.)
* Pour water into bowl, insert rice basket, and weigh in rice/quinoa/potatoes.
* Put lid on bowl, with Varoma on top. Add veges to lower Varoma tray, and place the upper Varoma tray on top. Line with wet baking paper, and arrange chicken on paper, drizzling with some of the sauce. Set remaining sauce aside for later.
* Start cooking for 20 minutes at Varoma temp, speed 4 for rice or quinoa, or 25 minutes for potatoes. When cooking time is finished, remove Varoma (set it on it's lid to catch drips) and remove rice/quinoa/potatoes and cooked veges to a Thermoserver or covered serving dish to keep warm. The chicken will need a little more time to cook.
* If you cooked rice/quinoa, there won't be much 'juice' left in the bowl. Add some more liquid by carefully draining the juices off the chicken into the bowl. Also, add the reserved BBQ sauce to the bowl (from marinating the chicken). Replace lid and Varoma (bottom tray will be empty), and cook for another 10 minutes at Varoma temperature, speed 2. Chicken should be done - cut a thigh in half to check.
* If you cooked potatoes in the basket, there'll be lots of water left in the bowl. Tip all but about 2 inches of water out. Add juices from chicken and reserved sauce, replace chicken in Varoma tray, and cook as above.
* Remove cooked chicken to another Thermoserver or covered serving dish. Make the sauce by adding cornstarch/arrowroot mixture (2 Tbspns cornstarch or arrowroot, mixed with 2 Tbspns water in a cup) to bowl and cooking at 100C for 4 minutes, speed 4.
* Serve chicken, veges and rice/quinoa/potatoes together, drizzled with the sauce.
