### Ingredients

* 10 oz olive oil
* 20 oz coconut oil
* 9 oz distilled water
* 4.78 oz 100% pure lye
* Essential oils for scent (optional)

### Other Equipment

* Digital scale
* Safety gear (safety glasses, long sleeves, gloves)
* Stick blender
* Crock pot
* Non-metal dishes and utensils

### Method

* Measure out the olive and coconut oil.
* Place the coconut oil in the slow cooker, and turn it on so it begins to melt.
* Measure out the other ingredients, weighing each and every one on the digital scale first.
* Once the coconut oil has completely melted, add the olive oil to the crockpot and allow it to mingle and warm up.
* Add the lye to the water, stirring slowly. Do this in a place with ample ventilation, while wearing your safety equipment.
* Add the dissolved lye/water mixture to the melted oils in the crockpot. Stir gently.
* With the stick blender, continue to mix/stir for several minutes until you reach "trace."
* Place the lid on the crockpot, set the timer for 50 minutes, and allow the mixture to cook on LOW.
* If the soap tries to bubble out of the crockpot, give it a stir.
* Line the soap molds with parchment paper (if required)
* Once the 50 minutes has elapsed, perform the "zap test": I like to do this by grabbing a small amount of the soap mixture, allowing to cool for a second, and then touching it to my tongue. If it "zaps" me, I know there is still lye remaining in the mixture and it needs to cook longer. If it just tastes like soap, we're ready for the next step.
* Allow the mixture to cool slightly before adding any additives.
* Press/pour the soap mixture into the mold, making sure to press it into all the corners and smooth out the top as much as possible.
* Set it aside for 12-24 hours, or until it sets completely. (Usually, overnight is plenty of time).
* Remove the soap from the mold, cut it into bars.
* Allow it to dry for another day or so to allow it to harden up a bit.
