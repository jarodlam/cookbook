* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp smoked paprika

* Handful fresh oregano (or tbsp. of dried)
* 300g shredded chicken

### Method

* Add onion, garlic and chilli to the bowl and chop on Speed 6 for 2 seconds.  *Add oil and spices and cook for 5 minutes at 100deg Reverse Speed 1.

### Notes

* To make your shredded chicken, chop up some chicken breasts and place in the Varoma trays.  Fill the TMX bowl with 1lt of water, place the Varoma on top and cook for 20 minutes at Varoma Speed 3.  Check to make sure the chicken is cooked, then drain water, add chicken to the bowl and shred on Reverse Speed 4 for about 10 seconds.
* You can season the chicken before cooking if you like.  I sprinkled with ground cumin, coriander and smoked paprika to infuse extra flavour.
