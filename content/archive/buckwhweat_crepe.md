### Ingredients

* 2  eggs
* 3/4 cup buckwheat flour
* 1 cup whole wheat flour, + 1 teaspoon
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 3 tablespoons salted butter
* button mushroom and roasted red bell pepper filling, as needed
* 18 thin slices raclette cheese

### Method

* Using a handheld mixer, whisk the eggs until foamy.
* Combine the flours and salt in a bowl. Sift the dry ingredients. Form a well in the center of the bowl. Pour in the eggs and ½ cup of water. Mix by hand for about 3-4 minutes until the batter is smooth. Do NOT over-mix. Add the oil.
* Let the crêpe batter rest for at least 2-3 hours (I let it rest overnight).
* Thin the crêpe batter with about 1/3 cup of water (up to 2/3 cup).
* Place your crêpe pan (or any flat pan) over medium heat. Grease it with a little butter using a silicone brush. Pour about ½ cup of the batter in the center of the pan. Lift the pan and then tilt and rotate it until the batter is evenly spread and forms a nice thin disk. 
* Put it back on the stove. It should start bubbling after a few seconds. Lower the heat to low. Place a slice of raclette cheese and add a little bit of the button mushroom and red bell pepper filling. 
* Fold the crêpe and let the cheese melt for 1-2 minutes. 
* The traditional method is to fold the edges of the crêpes in on all 4 sides by about 2 to 3 inches; this leaves the filling exposed.
* Repeat until all the ingredients are used. Stir the crêpe batter as you go for uniform consistency.
* Serve immediately with apple cider served in stoneware cups or kir (crème de cassis mixed with cider).
* Bon appétit!

### Tips

* The longer you let the batter rest the better. It will still be good after 2-3 days in the refrigerator.
* The first crêpe is never perfect. You might want to thin the batter with more water if the crêpe turns out too thick.
* The best spatula to flip crêpe is the one from Ikea. It's long, flat, heat resistant and gentle on non-stick pans. And it's inexpensive .
* If you're interested in making an Asian version, check out my recipe for banh xeo, it's a Vietnamese crêpe.
* For a vegan version, omit the butter and use only oil instead.
* I used whole wheat flour for health reasons. You could use all-purpose flour instead (measure 150 grams = 5.3 ounces) but you might want to reduce the amount of liquid.
