### Ingredients

* 6 Lamb Shanks
* 2 carrots chopped
* 2 celery stalks chopped
* 1 large onion
* 1 large garlic clove
* 1200g water
* 5 rosemary sprigs
* Prosciutto
* 400g tin tomatoes
* 1 heaped tbsp. vegetable stock
* Worcestershire sauce
* 2 bay leaves

### Method

* Add carrot and celery to the bowl and chop on Speed 5 for 2 seconds.  SET ASIDE.
* Add onion and garlic to the bowl and chop on Speed 6 for 3 seconds.  Add a dash of oil and saut√© for 10 minutes at Varoma Speed 1.
* Place the steamer basket in the bowl.  If none of your lamb shanks fit in the basket remove as much of the meat as you can from ONE only shank and place in the basket and add water to the bowl.
* Place the lid on the bowl and put the Varoma on top.  In the bottom lay the rosemary sprigs (they will help to keep the meat off the holes and allow air flow).  Arrange the remaining 5 shanks on top of the rosemary.  Place the lid on (no need for the top tray) and cook for 60 minutes at Varoma Speed 1.5.
* When finished, remove the varoma and basket.  Add tomatoes, bay leaves and stock paste to the bowl.  Place the basket back in and add the carrot and celery into it.  Put the lid on the bowl and place the varoma back on top.  Wrap the lamb in the prosciutto and drizzle with Worcestershire sauce.
* Cook for a further 60 minutes at Varoma Speed 2.  When done set the lamb shanks to one side.  Tip the carrots and celery into the sauce and add rosemary leaves  from the lamb (remove from sprig).  Use your spatula to stir through.
* Serve with fresh bread and mash potatoes.
