### Ingredients

* 180g plain flour
* 1 tablespoon of dried mixed herbs
* 1 tsp garlic powder, optional
* 80g cold butter, cubed
* 35g parmesan cheese, cubed
* 100g grated cheddar or similar cheese
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 - 2 tablespoons of cold water

### Method

* Preheat oven to 180 degrees. Line two baking trays with paper/mat.
* Place cheese into tmx bowl.
* Blitz on speed 7 until fine. Set aside.
* Place flour, herbs, garlic powder and butter into tmx.
* Blitz on speed 7 until a breadcrumb consistency is formed, approximately 6-8 seconds.
* Add cheese and salt to the flour.
* Blitz on speed 5 and slowly drizzle in the water through the lid until a dough forms. You may not need all the water. Approximately 20-25 seconds.

Wrap dough in cling wrap and place into the fridge to chill for about
20-30 minutes. If in a rush you can skip this step.

* Roll out dough until its only 3mm thick. Prick all over with a fork.
* Using a pizza cutter cut vertically and horizontally to form squares or rectangles. I do these very roughly. They don't have to be perfect. Or use your favourite cookie cutter.
* Place onto baking trays slightly apart.
* If you are wanting a super crunchy cracker place the tray into the fridge for 10-15 minutes for the dough to chill. You can skip this step however and still achieve a crunchy cracker.
* Bake for 15-18 minutes or until crisp. Keep an eye on them. Check after 10 minutes. You want them nice and crunchy but not burnt.
* Let cool on a wire rack.
