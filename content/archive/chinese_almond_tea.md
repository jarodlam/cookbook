### Ingredients

* 100g Chinese almonds (sweet - South Almonds)
* 1 tablespoon Chinese almonds (bitter - North almonds) (Mine are premixed, so I just used 100g of my mix)
* 10g white rice (original recipe states 20g, just adjust the amount for the desired thickness. Can also use other types of rice)
* 1 litre water
* 1 small lump of rock sugar (optional)
* Splash of milk (optional)

### Method

* Place almonds and rice in the TM bowl. Mill on speed 10 for 10sec. Scrape down bowl and repeat one more time.
* Add water and cook for 15mins at 100Â°C on speed 4.
* Add milk and sugar if using then mix for 30s on speed 9. (Increase speed gradually and cover measuring cup with a cloth to prevent splashing)
* Serve hot or cold.
