### Dough

## Ingredients

* 500g plain flour
* 350g boiling water

## Method

* Place the flour into the Thermomix bowl, mix on speed 5 for 10 seconds to lighten and aerate it slightly. Add boiling water and mix on speed 5 for 6 seconds. Then set to closed lid position and knead on interval speed for 2 minutes. Transfer to the Thermomat or a bowl to rest for approx 30 minutes.
* Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Using one part at a time, roll into a log and cut into 8 equal pieces. Take one piece and roll into a very thin round, using a rolling pin. I am not an expert getting it perfectly round with a rolling pin, here is a link to a youtube tutorial on how to do it, which I struggled with, so I cheated and got my perfect circle with a large glass!
* I found keeping a slightly damp tea towel over the dough kept it from drying out.

### Filling

## Ingredients

* 2 garlic cloves
* 2 spring onionssmall handful fresh chives
* 300g wombok
* 500g chicken mince

## Method

* Place garlic, spring onions and chives into TM bowl, chop on speed 6 for 5 sec. Add wombok and chop on speed 4 for 3 seconds (don’t do it for too long or it will turn to purée quickly!). Add mince, mix to combine on reverse speed 4 for 20 sec, use spatula through the lid to help combine the ingredients.
* Place a spoonful of the mince mixture into the middle of a circle and bring the edges together at the top and press firmly together, pleat one of the sides as you join them together.  Here is a video link on how to pleat the dumplings. Place in the Varoma dish and tray ready for steaming. Keep a little bit of space between them so they don’t stick.
* Once the Varoma is full, fill the TM bowl with 900ml of water and steam the dumplings on Varoma temp for 15 min speed 2.

### Dumplings

* To cook the dumplings on the stove, bring a large pot of water to the boil.
* When boiling, add some of the dumplings (don’t over crowd the pot). They will sink to the bottom, then rise to the top. 
* Add approx 1 cup of cold water when they rise to the surface. Continue boiling until the dumplings become translucent. 
* Remove with a slotted spoon. Continue this same method until all are cooked in batches.

### Dipping Sauce

## Ingredients

* 10 saffron threads
* 2 tablespoons of boiling water
* 2 tablespoons Rice malt syrup
* 1 tablespoon carob syrup
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/2 Shallot, thinly sliced
* 1/2 teaspoon rock salt, ground

## Method

* Place the saffron threads into a small bowl. Add the hot water and set aside for a few minutes. 
* Mix the remaining dipping sauce ingredients together and stir well to combine. 
* Add the saffron and water. Store in the fridge until ready to use.

### Chive Pancakes

## Ingredients

* Dumpling Dough
* Spray oil
* 3 eggs
* Pinch of garlic salt
* fresh chives, chopped

## Method

* Using any of the left over dough that has been prepared exactly the same way as the dumplings, rolled out thinly in a small round circle. Beat the eggs together with garlic salt.
* Heat up a non stick frying pan, spray with oil. Brush one side of the dough with beaten egg, sprinkle with chives and place egg side down in the pan. Brush the top side with egg while it’s cooking and sprinkle with chives. Allow to cook for a few minutes until lightly browned and the egg is cooked, flip over and cook the other side. Once cooked on both sides, remove and keep warm until ready to serve.
