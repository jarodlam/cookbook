### Ingredients - Marinade

* 60g almonds
* 1 onion
* 25g fresh ginger
* 3 garlic cloves
* ½ -2 red chillies (Don’t go crazy otherwise the spices will get lost!)
* Olive oil
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 4 cardamom pods
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 4 cloves
* 2 fresh bay leaves 
* 200g greek yoghurt
* 60g chicken stock paste or vegetable stock paste
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 6-8 chicken thigh (cut in quarters)
* 100g cream

### Method

* Add almonds to a dry bowl and mill on Speed 8 for 8 seconds.  SET ASIDE.
* Add onion, chilli, garlic and ginger to the bowl and chop on Speed 6 for 3 seconds.  Add some oil (approx. 20g) and cumin, coriander and garam masala and cook for 5 minutes at Varoma Speed 1.
* Meanwhile add cinnamon stick, cloves and cardamom pods to a small frypan along with a drizzle of oil and heat until fragrant (approx. 1 min).
* Add all ingredients EXCEPT chicken and cream to the bowl (including almonds) and cook for 15 minutes at 90deg Reverse Speed 1.  
* NOTE: When I made this I added 100g of water but I found the sauce was too thin at the end and needed reducing.  I have removed the water but if you think yours needs water then please add.
* Blitz the sauce by slowly taking the dial up to Speed 9 for 1 minute.
* Add the chicken and cook for 15 minutes at 100deg Reverse Soft Speed.
* Add cream and cook for a further 5 minutes at 100deg Reverse Soft Speed.
