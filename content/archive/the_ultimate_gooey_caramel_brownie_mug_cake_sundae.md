### Ingredients

## Cake

* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (30g)
* 2 tablespoons chocolate chips (half bittersweet and half semisweet)
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 square of your favorite dark chocolate bar

## Topping (optional)

* 3 Werther’s Original® Baking Caramels
* 2 teaspoons milk
* melted chocolate chips
* vanilla bean ice cream or gelato
* crushed toasted nuts
* crushed cookie
* whipped cream

### Method

* NOTE (from website): I used a big espresso mug for this cake, but you can use any regular size coffee mug that’s microwave safe. Different microwaves may require different cooking times, but your finished cake should look set up but very moist.

* Place butter and chocolate chips in a coffee mug and heat on half power for 15 second intervals, stirring between each interval, until melted (about 45 seconds total). In a separate small bowl or ramekin, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate small bowl or ramekin, whisk together the egg, vanilla extract, and espresso powder. When the chocolate is melted in your mug, stir in sugar and cocoa powder. Stir in the egg mixture. Stir in the flour mixture. Stir well to eliminate lumps.

* Microwave the mug on half power for 30 seconds (I set mine on a plate just in case there’s spillover). Stir. Microwave on half power for 35 seconds (the cake will rise over the top of your mug like a giant soufflé, but stay calm.) Press the square of chocolate bar down into the center of the cake (I broke mine into two pieces), being careful not to burn your fingers. Microwave on half power for 40 seconds. Let the cake cool in the mug for 2 minutes while you prepare your toppings.

* Melt the chocolate chips by heating on half power for 20 second intervals, stirring between each, until melty. Melt the Werther’s Original® Baking Caramels by placing them in a small bowl with the milk. Heat on 30 second intervals, stirring carefully between each, until melty. Top your mug cake with a big scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, crushed toasted pecans, a crushed cookie (I used a Biscoff cookie), and the kitchen sink. Just kidding about the sink. Enjoy!
