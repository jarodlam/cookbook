### Method

* Place all ingredients into your mixing jug and mix until well combined.  Approx 10sec, reverse, sp 3.
* Text mix by squeezing between two fingers and if it holds firm then it's good to press into your moulds.  If it is too dry then use another tbl of coconut oil.  This will set form once on the fridge.
