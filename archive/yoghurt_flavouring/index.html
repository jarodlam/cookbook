<ul>
<li>When making any Yogurt please refer to original post for the general tips and method.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=vanilla-yoghurt-sweetened>Vanilla Yoghurt (sweetened)</h3>
<h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1.5ltr Full Cream Milk</li>
<li>50g Raw Sugar</li>
<li>20g Vanilla Extract</li>
<li>100- 200ml Yoghurt Starter</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=method>Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simply add sugar and Vanilla during initial heating process,</li>
<li>I have used Vanilla beans which are split to release bean flavour more, but find a lot of the vanilla is wasted as it floats, therefore when you remove any ‘skin’ during the milk cooling the Vanilla is lost.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=honey-yoghurt>Honey Yoghurt</h3>
<h3 id=ingredients-1>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1.5ltr Full Cream Milk</li>
<li>85g Honey</li>
<li>100- 200ml Yoghurt Starter</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=method-1>Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add the honey during the heating process, this does taste very sweet in the milk, but as the yogurt thickens it mellows out, but sweetness is relative so adjust to taste.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=bitter-orange-couliscompote>Bitter Orange Coulis/Compote</h3>
<ul>
<li>This originated from being asked for an Orange Jam recipe and I loved the result served with my yogurt and so did the kids.</li>
<li>I do not put as much sugar in this coulis as I did the jam though. The recipe can be adapted for any fruit of choice, so I have given two versions to play around with!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=ingredients-2>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zest of half an Orange (optional)</li>
<li>500g Orange peel and pith cut off</li>
<li>100g Raw Sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=method-2>Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Place zest and sugar in TM bowl and mill for 10 -15 sec, speed 9. Scrape down and give a little longer if necessary</li>
<li>Add orange flesh, with any visible pips removed. Pulverise 8 secs speed 9, then cook for 20mins, Varoma temp, speed 1 with MC off (keep an eye as may boil up into top well, you can always drop temp to 100 degrees for a while)</li>
<li>Once cooked transfer to a container to cool before marbelling through yogurt or adding a spoonful as required.</li>
<li>Recipe should yield approx 300g</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=mixed-fruit-couliscompote>Mixed fruit Coulis/compote</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is basically the same as the above but I have used frozen mixed berries, but you could try it with any seasonal produce and you will probably get a good result.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=ingredients-3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>150g Sugar</li>
<li>Zest and Juice of 1 Lemon (optional depending on pectin content)</li>
<li>500g Frozen Mixed Berries</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=method-3>Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Method is exactly the same as above, but I found the yield slightly higher which maybe because I replaced the MC in last 5 – 10 mins (can’t remember why!).You can play with the consistency by adjusting the temp between 100 degree’s and varoma, obviously the more varoma time the thicker it will become, test on a plate of chilled water to see how it holds.</li>
