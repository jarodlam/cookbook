<p>How to make natural liquid foundation Natural Liquid Foundation Recipe
I&rsquo;ve shared my homemade powdered makeup recipes before but I&rsquo;ve been
playing with a liquid foundation or creme recipe for months (ok, years).</p>
<p>Until now, it has just frustrated me and all of the trial recipes turned
into tinted body butters or cremes because they didn&rsquo;t offer enough
coverage or offered too much. Some looked grainy, others streaky, others
just fake.</p>
<p>Natural Liquid Foundation&mldr;</p>
<p>After dozens of tries, I finally found a recipe for a liquid foundation
that offers coverage and looks amazing on skin but doesn&rsquo;t look like it
would be better suited for a clown.</p>
<p>It combines many of my favorite natural skin ingredients like shea
butter and argan oil with natural minerals and clays. Once I discovered
how to make a good base for this recipe, it was easy to create natural
creme blush and concealer as well.</p>
<p>The Base Moisturizer</p>
<p>There are actually two options for the base of this recipe: the simple
way or the DIY way.</p>
<p>For a simpler version, use a natural pre-made moisturizer for the base
and add colors and pigments as needed. The DIY way takes a little more
time and five ingredients but allows more customization since you&rsquo;re
making the base lotion yourself. If you prefer the pre-made option, I
recommend using one of these two natural lotions, which both are rated
as safe by the Environmental Working Group (and they make your skin feel
incredible!):</p>
<p>Shea Moisture Argan and Chamomile Healing Lotion Shea Moisture Olive Oil
and Marula Lotion If you want to use the homemade version, you&rsquo;ll need
these ingredients for the base:</p>
<p>shea butter argan oil aloe vera gel witch hazel vegetable based
emulsifying wax And these ingredients to add to the base for color and
coverage:</p>
<p>kaolin clay, Earth Clay or Bentonite Clay mica powder in color of choice
(I used bronze and gold) organic cocoa powder zinc oxide powder (non
nano and uncoated) or white cosmetic clay OR natural mineral makeup in
your color (in place of ingredients above) Cost Comparison</p>
<p>Per ounce, this foundation is much less expensive than leading brands,
and drastically cheaper than organic brands. I wasn&rsquo;t able to nail down
the exact price per ounce since so little of each ingredient was used.</p>
<p>If you already have all or most of the ingredients on hand from other
projects, the DIY base version is going to be less expensive. If you
don&rsquo;t, using a natural lotion with similar ingredients is going to be
less expensive.</p>
<p>All of the ingredients have other uses and even just a few ounces of
each will make months and months of makeup. (I recommend making in small
batches if using the homemade version since it won&rsquo;t have a long shelf
life and should be used within a few weeks).</p>
<p>Customizing to Your Skin Tone</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using a pre-made mineral makeup in your skin tone, just add to
the pre-made or homemade lotion until you get the desired color and
coverage.</p>
<p>For the homemade version, I recommend making the base lotion (details
below) and testing on your skin to make sure you like the coverage and
texture. Once you create your custom base, start adding the color
powders (clays, mica, cocoa, zinc, etc) little by little to get the
color and coverage you want.</p>
<p>Some tips I discovered along the way:</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using zinc oxide (which is used in many mineral makeups and my
natural sunscreen), you&rsquo;ll want to add it first for the coverage aspect.
I added about 5 times as much non-nano zinc oxide as other color
ingredients Then, add clays and sprinkle them on very lightly to prevent
clumping. I found that a tiny bit of french green clay and fullers earth
clay helped even out my skin tone Then, add color slowly (you can&rsquo;t undo
this part!). I started by sprinkling tiny amounts of cocoa powder,
bronze mica powder and gold mica powder and mixing until I got a color
that worked for my skin. I tested this on the inside of my arm for color
and consistency before putting on my face. If you want, you can add a
couple drops of a skin-safe essential oil like lavender or frankincense
or rose for scent and added benefit. The zinc and clays offer coverage
and smoothing, the mica and cocoa add color and bronzing. Add both
slowly until the desired color and coverage are reached. Let cool and
re-test on the inner arm or neck to confirm it is the right color. If
you want a thicker creme foundation, add slightly more emulsifying wax
or shea butter. If you prefer a smoother/thinner coverage, add slightly
less or up the aloe and witch hazel. 4.7 from 7 reviews Natural Liquid

<h3 id=how-to-store-homemade-foundation-1>How to Store Homemade Foundation</h3>
<ul>
<li>This can be easily stored in a glass jar or old makeup container. My favorite way to store is in a silicon squeezable tube for easy application. This helps prevent contamination since you aren’t reaching into the makeup container and keeps it fresh longer.</li>
<li>I prefer to squeeze a small amount onto a makeup sponge and apply. A little goes a long way!</li>
