<ul>
<li>1 part oil</li>
<li>2 parts water (or rose water, green tea, aloe-vera gel, etc)</li>
<li>1/4 part beeswax</li>
<li>To this, you can also add:</li>
<li>1/8 to 1/4 part cocoa or shea butter, if using</li>
<li>a few drops of essential oil or oils of your choice – add them to the water prior to incorporating.</li>
<li>In this particular recipe, for example, I’ve used 6 tablespoons of avocado oil plus 2 tablespoons jojoba oil (1/2 cup of oil total), 2 tablespoons cocoa butter, 2 tablespoons beeswax, and 1 cup of water.</li>
<li>The first step is to melt together your beeswax, oils, and cocoa or shea butters, if using. I prefer to do it in a microwave, using a mason jar in which I intend to blend and store my lotion. It takes about two minutes on high for everything to melt completely.</li>
<li>However, I understand that some people seeking to make their own lotion are doing so out of the crunchiness of their hearts and despise microwaving. If this is you, or if you simply don’t have a microwave, just melt everything together in a double boiler.</li>
<li>Whatever your values or melting preferences, continue to heat your mixture until there are no solid particles remaining.</li>
<li>Allow your mixture to cool slightly before using, but not all the way to room temperature.</li>
<li>Next, stick your immersion blender into the beeswax-oil mixture and run it while slowly pouring in the water (your water and oil need to be about the same temperature). At first your mixture may resemble cheese curds floating in water, but press on and watch everything transform into a smooth, white lotion.</li>
<li>If some of the water ends up not being incorporated, just pour it off and blend what remains. No biggie!</li>
<li>If you only have a jar blender, melt your oil and beeswax in a mason jar, allow to cool, add all the water at once, and screw the blender blade base on like you would a lid. Did you know you could do that?</li>
<li>Now allow the blender to blend everything for about a minute, or until you arrive at the lotion consistency.</li>
<li>Just be sure to wipe your blender blade or attachment well with a paper towel prior to washing, which will absorb and remove most of the oily/waxy stuff.</li>
