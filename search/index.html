Stir with a whisk. Gradually whisk gelatin into the mixture, stirring constantly. (Avoid dumping gelatin into pan all at once, which will cause big globs of gelatin to remain in finished product.) Continue heating over medium-low heat until all ingredients are well combined and gelatin is completely melted. (The mixture will change from a grainy, jelly-like consistency to a more glassy, smooth consistency when gelatin is all melted.) Place gummy bear mold on a cookie sheet (which makes it easier to move without spilling once filled). Pour mixture into silicone mold and place in freezer for about 20-30 minutes. Pop gummy bears out of mold and store in an airtight container. They will keep in the refrigerator for a few weeks.  Note  You can also pour mixture into a baking dish greased with coconut oil if you don’t have silicone molds.

I prefer using a sweet greek or vanilla yoghurt. Also if you make a plain yoghurt (no sugar or vanilla) \u0026amp; culture for too long your yoghurt will be tart. The little bacteria in the yoghurt eat the milk sugars \u0026amp; turn them into lactic acid. FRIDGE LIFE. This yoghurt will easily last 2-3 weeks if no one double dips Wink Always judge by smell \u0026amp; taste.DONT FORGET! Once your yoghurt has set, place ¼ cup into a clean container \u0026amp; store somewhere in the fridge where no one will eat it. This can be used to make your next batch!USING FRESH MILK. You MUST first cook your milk at 90* for atleast 10 minutes, then allow it to cool back to under 37* before using. This breaks down the proteins in the milk. This is why I use UHT as I can skip this process.USING AN EASIYO SACHET AS A STARTER. You may split the easiyo sachet into 4 portions \u0026amp; use 1 portion (1/4 packet) in place of the starter.

It\u0026rsquo;s important to start with clean hands and use clean tools to make sure the gel doesn\u0026rsquo;t get contaminated. Slice off an outer leaf of an aloe plant. The outer leaves are more likely to be mature. They\u0026rsquo;ll contain plenty of fresh, healthy gel. Drain the resin for 10 minutes. Place the leaves upright in a cup to let the dark yellow resin drain out. The resin contains latex, which can be slightly irritating to skin. It\u0026rsquo;s best to drain it out so it won\u0026rsquo;t get into your gel. Peel the leaves. Use a vegetable peeler to carefully peel away the green portion of the leaves.[[1]] Be sure to cut through the inner white layer to the gel underneath. Peel off all of the skin on once side of the each leaf, leaving a canoe-shaped half filled with gel. Scoop the gel out with a spoon. The clear, soft gel is easily scoopable. Scoop it all out into a clean bowl until there\u0026rsquo;s nothing left in the leaf half. Consider mixing the gel with a natural preservative. If you have a lot of gel and you want it to keep for a month or two, mix in 500mg powdered Vitamin C or 400 IU vitamin E for every 1/4 cup of gel you have. Place the ingredients together in a blender and blend well. The gel will look foamy at first. Place the gel in a sterilized, clean glass jar. If you used the preservative, the gel will keep for several months in the refrigerator. Without it, it will keep for a week or two.  Use of Gel  Apply it to sunburns or other minor, surface burns. Aloe can also be used as a skin moisturizer or an ingredient in homemade body products. Never use aloe vera gel on deep cuts or blistered skin. It should only be used on surface skin irritation, since it can prevent deep cuts from healing properly. Try blending 1/2 cup aloe with 1/4 cup melted coconut oil to make a healing, moisturizing massage lotion.

I put all of my essential oils into one cup so that I could just pour them into the beeswax mixture when the time came. The recipe from Mrs. Child’s book calls for equal parts of each essential oil. I decided to use sweet almond oil for my carrier oil because I had some on hand and it seemed more authentic to the period of this recipe. I’ve seen several mentions of almond oil in 19th century books and magazines, but I’ve never seen a mention of jojoba oil. If you don’t have almond oil available, though, jojoba oil would work just as well. In a separate cup from the essential oils, I measured out two teaspoons of almond oil. Measuring the oil out ahead of time saves you from rushing around once your beeswax is melted. If you have beeswax pellets, simple measure out 2 tsp and melt them in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. If you have a solid block of beeswax, I’ve found that the best way to get the two teaspoons of beeswax was to grate off about a tablespoon of shavings, melt them in a saucepan at medium-low heat, and then measure to make sure I had two teaspoons. After measuring, I found that I had to heat the beeswax back up in the pan again for a few more seconds because it had started to harden after I poured it into my measuring spoon. If you find that you don’t have quite two teaspoons, you can just shave off a bit more beeswax and add it to the pot. If you have more than two teaspoons, just save the extra for another project. Once you have two teaspoons of melted beeswax, add the two teaspoons of carrier oil to the pot and stir around a bit until they are combined. Then take the pot off the burner and quickly (quickly!) add in the essential oils. Stir for just a bit until combined. As quickly as possible, pour the mixture into your container.

It’s important to use a foaming dispenser, since the dispenser is what creates the actual foam. They’re kind of pricy online, so just use an old empty one, or ask your neighbor for their used ones. I guess you could always go dumpster diving, but that’s probably not first choice. Gently swirl ingredients together. You can see below how far the non-water ingredients come up on the bottle I used. Add water to the top of the bottle and twist on the lid. Gently swirl ingredients together again. I pulled the label sticker off of my empty dispenser. It came off really easily. And that’s it. Push the dispenser a few times and just like magic, homemade foaming hand soap appears! The fractionated coconut oil provides some moisturizing benefit and the melaleuca oil is naturally anti bacterial. I chose Citrus Bliss essential blend as my fragrance because I love citrusy scents for my hand soaps. Honestly, you could even bag the essential oils and coconut oil and go with just the castile soap and water. It would still foam just fine and come out even cheaper. You can even buy already scented castile soap. My hands get super dry and I love to shake up the scent of mine every once in a while, so that’s why I use the coconut and essential oils. Also, sometimes I find my ingredients have separated, so a quick swish around and it’s good to go again.

Apply the hand butter to your dry hands as often as needed–especially after a long day working outside or playing in the dirt.  Notes  Shea butter is known to provide powerful moisturizing and nourishing benefits for the skin. You could also substitute half of the shea butter for 1/8 cup cocoa butter or coconut oil. Sweet almond oil is a wonderful moisturizer that also contains vitamins that nourish and soothe the skin. If you don’t have sweet almond, you can substitute jojoba oil, olive oil, etc. The beeswax in this recipe helps the hand butter to set up and stay firm. It also coats the skin and protects it. If you want your hand butter to be softer, try reducing the beeswax. If you would like it firmer, increase the amount of beeswax.

Spoon the finished body butter into a cute little jar. Apply as needed to dry skin anywhere on your body, or give it as a gift!  Notes  It’s really important to allow the body butter to set up, otherwise it won’t whip. I’ve found it’s ready to whip when I can stick my finger in the middle and it will hold the indentation. However, if you accidentally forget about your body butter in the fridge or freezer and it gets too hard, all is not lost. Simply allow it to thaw at room temperature until it reaches the proper consistency. You can easily store your whipped body butter at room temperature. However, if your house is very warm, it may melt. But if this happens, you can simply re-whip and you’ll be good to go. My favorite essential oil for this recipe is peppermint–especially peppermint combined with the white chocolate body butter recipe… YUM.

Transfer the mixture into a mason jar where you intend to make and keep your lotion, and allow it to cool until warm – but not all the way to room temperature. Begin to blend the mixture with an immersion blender while slowly pouring in the warm water (be sure that you water and oil are about the same temperature to prevent the separation). Continue to blend and watch it transform into a thick, white lotion we all know and love. For clean-up, use a paper towel to wipe down the blender attachment prior to washing it in hot water and dish-washing soap. Your lotion will keep for at least a month in refrigerator.  Notes  Add 1 tsp of vitamin E. Cocoa butter is especially amazing because of its rich, decadent chocolate aroma, and cocoa-butter-based lotion needs no additional fragrances. Shea butter on the other hand is completely odorless, which makes it a great candidate for when you want a fragrance-free lotion, or if you wish to scent it with an essential oil which would otherwise clash with the cocoa scent. If you want your lotion to smell like pure lavender, for instance, shea butter is the way to go.  Glycerin or honey  Both glycerin and honey are humectants, which is the name for substances that help retain moisture. Adding a bit of glycerin to a lotion gives it a pleasantly slippery feel, but be careful not to add too much or your lotion will feel sticky. A little squirt is all you need. Glycerin can be either vegetable (i.e. plant-derived) or the regular kind (made from animal or petroleum-based oils, as far as I understand). Regular glycerin can be found at drug stores and vegetable glycerin is often sold in food co-ops and such.  Aloe Vera Gel  You can also substitute the water in the recipe with bottled aloe vera gel, which will make your lotion really smooth and slippery like store brands. By contrast, lotions made with plain water will feel more like body butters.  Oatmeal Water  Boil NON-instant rolled oats in water for a ten minutes, allow to cool, strain out the water, and use it in place of regular water in your lotion. Another way to get a nice, slippery lotion!  Green Tea  Substitute green tea for the water in the recipe.  Essential Oils  If you wish to use your favorite essential oils, add a few drops to the water prior to mixing it with the melted wax-and-oil combo. I am wild and crazy about lavender, for instance, and make at least some lavender lotion on a regular basis.  Water  Water does not need to be distilled. Personally, I just use my regular hard water from the well on my farm – the same water we drink every day – and it works just fine. If you only have unfiltered, chlorinated city water, you may wanna go with distilled water instead.  Beeswax  Beeswax! It will need to be grated. I use my regular hand grater, which I afterwards wash in hot water and dawn while helping myself along with a metal scrubber. But, again, beeswax is edible, so any residue shouldn’t be a problem.  I\u0026rsquo;ve tried making lotion before but it later separated. What gives?  Your water and oil-beeswax mixture need to be about the same temperature as you are combining them.

In this particular recipe, for example, I’ve used 6 tablespoons of avocado oil plus 2 tablespoons jojoba oil (1/2 cup of oil total), 2 tablespoons cocoa butter, 2 tablespoons beeswax, and 1 cup of water. The first step is to melt together your beeswax, oils, and cocoa or shea butters, if using. I prefer to do it in a microwave, using a mason jar in which I intend to blend and store my lotion. It takes about two minutes on high for everything to melt completely. However, I understand that some people seeking to make their own lotion are doing so out of the crunchiness of their hearts and despise microwaving. If this is you, or if you simply don’t have a microwave, just melt everything together in a double boiler. Whatever your values or melting preferences, continue to heat your mixture until there are no solid particles remaining. Allow your mixture to cool slightly before using, but not all the way to room temperature. Next, stick your immersion blender into the beeswax-oil mixture and run it while slowly pouring in the water (your water and oil need to be about the same temperature). At first your mixture may resemble cheese curds floating in water, but press on and watch everything transform into a smooth, white lotion. If some of the water ends up not being incorporated, just pour it off and blend what remains. No biggie! If you only have a jar blender, melt your oil and beeswax in a mason jar, allow to cool, add all the water at once, and screw the blender blade base on like you would a lid. Did you know you could do that? Now allow the blender to blend everything for about a minute, or until you arrive at the lotion consistency. Just be sure to wipe your blender blade or attachment well with a paper towel prior to washing, which will absorb and remove most of the oily/waxy stuff.

I personally feel safe using zinc oxide on my skin (non nano and uncoated) but if you don\u0026rsquo;t, just stick to the arrowroot version.

How to store homemade foundation  You are here: Home » Blog » Beauty » Natural Liquid Foundation Recipe  Natural Liquid Foundation Recipe Katie - Wellness Mama 73 Comments Affiliate Disclosure\nHow to make natural liquid foundation Natural Liquid Foundation Recipe I\u0026rsquo;ve shared my homemade powdered makeup recipes before but I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing with a liquid foundation or creme recipe for months (ok, years).\nUntil now, it has just frustrated me and all of the trial recipes turned into tinted body butters or cremes because they didn\u0026rsquo;t offer enough coverage or offered too much. Some looked grainy, others streaky, others just fake.\nNatural Liquid Foundation\u0026hellip;\nAfter dozens of tries, I finally found a recipe for a liquid foundation that offers coverage and looks amazing on skin but doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like it would be better suited for a clown.\nIt combines many of my favorite natural skin ingredients like shea butter and argan oil with natural minerals and clays. Once I discovered how to make a good base for this recipe, it was easy to create natural creme blush and concealer as well.\nThe Base Moisturizer\nThere are actually two options for the base of this recipe: the simple way or the DIY way.\nFor a simpler version, use a natural pre-made moisturizer for the base and add colors and pigments as needed. The DIY way takes a little more time and five ingredients but allows more customization since you\u0026rsquo;re making the base lotion yourself. If you prefer the pre-made option, I recommend using one of these two natural lotions, which both are rated as safe by the Environmental Working Group (and they make your skin feel incredible!):\nShea Moisture Argan and Chamomile Healing Lotion Shea Moisture Olive Oil and Marula Lotion If you want to use the homemade version, you\u0026rsquo;ll need these ingredients for the base:\nshea butter argan oil aloe vera gel witch hazel vegetable based emulsifying wax And these ingredients to add to the base for color and coverage:\nkaolin clay, Earth Clay or Bentonite Clay mica powder in color of choice (I used bronze and gold) organic cocoa powder zinc oxide powder (non nano and uncoated) or white cosmetic clay OR natural mineral makeup in your color (in place of ingredients above) Cost Comparison\nPer ounce, this foundation is much less expensive than leading brands, and drastically cheaper than organic brands. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to nail down the exact price per ounce since so little of each ingredient was used.\nIf you already have all or most of the ingredients on hand from other projects, the DIY base version is going to be less expensive. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, using a natural lotion with similar ingredients is going to be less expensive.\nAll of the ingredients have other uses and even just a few ounces of each will make months and months of makeup. (I recommend making in small batches if using the homemade version since it won\u0026rsquo;t have a long shelf life and should be used within a few weeks).\nCustomizing to Your Skin Tone\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using a pre-made mineral makeup in your skin tone, just add to the pre-made or homemade lotion until you get the desired color and coverage.\nFor the homemade version, I recommend making the base lotion (details below) and testing on your skin to make sure you like the coverage and texture. Once you create your custom base, start adding the color powders (clays, mica, cocoa, zinc, etc) little by little to get the color and coverage you want.\nSome tips I discovered along the way:\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using zinc oxide (which is used in many mineral makeups and my natural sunscreen), you\u0026rsquo;ll want to add it first for the coverage aspect. I added about 5 times as much non-nano zinc oxide as other color ingredients Then, add clays and sprinkle them on very lightly to prevent clumping. I found that a tiny bit of french green clay and fullers earth clay helped even out my skin tone Then, add color slowly (you can\u0026rsquo;t undo this part!). I started by sprinkling tiny amounts of cocoa powder, bronze mica powder and gold mica powder and mixing until I got a color that worked for my skin. I tested this on the inside of my arm for color and consistency before putting on my face. If you want, you can add a couple drops of a skin-safe essential oil like lavender or frankincense or rose for scent and added benefit. The zinc and clays offer coverage and smoothing, the mica and cocoa add color and bronzing. Add both slowly until the desired color and coverage are reached. Let cool and re-test on the inner arm or neck to confirm it is the right color. If you want a thicker creme foundation, add slightly more emulsifying wax or shea butter. If you prefer a smoother/thinner coverage, add slightly less or up the aloe and witch hazel. 4.7 from 7 reviews Natural Liquid Foundation Recipe\nHow to make natural liquid foundation 300x210 Natural Liquid Foundation Recipe Print Prep time 10 mins Cook time 5 mins Total time 15 mins\nMake your own natural liquid foundation with natural ingredients like argan oil, shea butter, aloe, witch hazel and natural colors. Author: Wellness Mama Recipe type: Beauty Ingredients 2 teaspoons of argan oil or jajoba oil 1 teaspoon of shea butter ½ tsp emulsifying wax 1 tablespoon aloe gel 1 teaspoon witch hazel OR 3 tablespoons of natural pre-made lotion (in place of first 5 ingredients) 1-4 teaspoons non-nano zinc oxide ¼-1/2 tsp cocoa powder 1//2-1 tsp mica powder of choice ½ tsp clay of choice (if using) OR 2-3 teaspoons of All-natural mineral powder in color of choice Instructions If making the simple version... just mix the organic lotion and mineral powder to get the desired color and consistency. For the complete DIY: Melt the shea butter, argan oil and emulsifying wax in a double boiler until completely melted. Add the aloe and witch hazel and whisk until completely incorporated and smooth. Turn heat off. Slowly, start adding colors. Start with zinc and clays until desired coverage is reached. It will still be too pale at this point.

Test the color and coverage on your forehead to make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve achieved the right tone for your skin. Spoon the mixture into the desired container and let cool.\nHow to Store Homemade Foundation  This can be easily stored in a glass jar or old makeup container. My favorite way to store is in a silicon squeezable tube for easy application. This helps prevent contamination since you aren’t reaching into the makeup container and keeps it fresh longer. I prefer to squeeze a small amount onto a makeup sponge and apply. A little goes a long way!

In a medium-sized bowl, combine aloe vera gel, vitamin E oil, and essential oils. Pour the melted oils into a blender and allow them to cool to room temperature. This is a vital step in order to prevent separation. Once cooled, with blender on low speed, slowly and continuously pour in aloe vera mixture. Run a rubber spatula against the sides of the blender to incorporate all ingredients. Blend until the mixture has the look and feel of lotion. Note: This step may also be performed in a mixing bowl with the use of a handheld electric mixer. Pour the lotion into sterilized jars. You can use sterilized canning jars if you have them on hand. I keep a jar on the bathroom counter and one in the refrigerator. The lotion will keep for up to 6 weeks in the refrigerator.  Notes  Almond oil and grapeseed oil are readily absorbed by the skin thereby leaving the non-greasy feeling. My favorite essential oil combination for this lotion is geranium and lime! -This lotion is not only perfectly moisturizing for these winter months, but with the addition of aloe gel, I anticipate this recipe will carry me through the summer as well! I think it’s going to be perfect for those after-to-much-sun days.

Grate it with a dollar store or old cheese grater. You will never be able to use it for anything else after you grate beeswax on it. 1 (2?) Tablespoon Coconut Oil {the kind you cook with} 2 teaspoons sweet almond oil A chunk of some red lipstick. How much depends on your preference. Just keep in mind that it will look dark in the pot but won’t be that dark on. A lot of color goes a little way. 1/2 teaspoon of shimmery eye shadow – to add some subtle sparkle. 10 drops essential oils - lemon or orange  Method  Boil water in a small sauce pan and rest a metal bowl on top – to make a double boiler. Or with a small metal bowl in a larger pan of boiling water to give it more of a “water bath.” Melt all the ingredients together until it liquefies and there are no more visible beeswax flakes. Then immediately remove it from the heat. You don’t want to overcook it or boil it. It will not last as long {get grainy and rancid} if you do. Use a bamboo skewer or other throw way tool, to stir it. Off heat, stir in 10 drops or so of essential oil. I used peppermint but lemon or orange would be so yummy for summer. You add the essential oil at this stage so that it doesn’t completely evaporate away during cooking. Then using a disposable medicine dropper fill your lip gloss containers. You can pour it instead, but this helps it look cleaner. Let it sit at room temperature or in the fridge {speeds things up} for a couple of hours so that it completely hardens and turns opaque. And now you have a soothing, smooth lip balm with just a hint of color and a hint of sun protection.

Add the milk, eggs and butter, and mix on low speed with the dough hook until combined.\n  Raise the mixer speed to medium and knead for about 5 minutes. The dough is a lovely, smooth, enriched dough. It climbs up the dough hook during kneading but remains intact and smooth.\n  Spray a silicone spatula lightly with cooking oil spray, and scrape down the sides of the bowl.\n  Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl or proofing bucket large enough for the dough to rise to double its size, spray the top of the dough with cooking oil spray, and cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap (or the oiled top to your proofing bucket).\n  Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days.**\n  Note: If you prefer, you may make and use this dough on the same day. It will not be as easy to handle, however, but you can work with it. To use the dough the same day it is made, after making the dough, set the covered dough to rise in a warm, draft-free environment to allow it to rise to double its size (about 1 hour). Once it has doubled, place it in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes or until it is chilled. This will make it much easier to handle. Then, continue with the rest of the recipe instructions.\n  Preparing the dough for shaping. On baking day, line a small rimmed baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper, and set it aside. Turn out the chilled dough onto a lightly floured surface and, using the scrape and fold kneading method and using a very light touch, sprinkle the dough with more flour and knead it lightly, sprinkling with flour when necessary to prevent it from sticking, scrape the dough off the floured surface with a floured bench scraper, then fold it over on itself. Repeat scraping and folding until the dough has become smoother. Do not overwork the dough or you will incorporate too much flour and it will not rise properly.\n  Rolling out and filling the dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick, and 12-inches high x 15-inches wide, sprinkling very lightly with more bread flour as necessary to prevent sticking. As you work, shift and move the dough frequently, as shown in my pizza shaping video. Before the dough is fully shaped, transfer it to lightly greased piece of unbleached parchment paper. You will use the parchment paper to help roll the dough into a cylinder. Dust off any excess flour from the surface of the rectangle facing up (this will help the Nutella adhere to the dough), and spread the warmed Nutella in an even layer on the dough, leaving a 3/4-inch border clean around the perimeter. Beginning at a 15-inch side of the dough, and using the parchment paper to assist you, roll the filled dough tightly into a cylinder, like a jelly roll, ending with the seam side down. Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to chill for about 10 minutes. This will make the final shaping infinitely easier.\n  Final shaping and rise. Once the dough has finished chilling, remove it from the refrigerator and uncover it. With a very sharp knife or pizza wheel, beginning about 1-inch from one end of the roll of dough, slice along the length of the dough all the way through to the end. You will have 2 strands of layered dough. Beginning at the intact end, twist each strand gently so that the cut sides of the dough are facing up. Braid the strands gently but securely back and forth over one another until you reach the end. You should have 4 or 5 twists before you reach the end. Cinch the open ends together and tuck them under the bread slightly. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Place one hand on each end of the braid, and press the ends gently toward one another to create a slightly wider, shorter braid. This will help the braid rise together and adhere to create a nice loaf. Cover the baking sheet with a piece of oiled plastic wrap, and place in warm, draft-free location to rise only until just beginning to swell (about 20 minutes, but it could be more if your rising environment is particularly cold and/or dry). Do not overproof.\n  Bake. As the dough is in its final rise, preheat your oven to 375°F. Once the dough has finished rising, uncover it, brush the surface evenly with the egg wash, and place in the center of the preheated oven. Bake for 10 minutes, and turn the oven temperature down to 350°F. Continue to bake until the dough is golden brown all over (about 15 minutes more). If you would like the Nutella to remain a bit gooey, remove from the oven when the dough is brown on top, but still gives very slightly when pressed on top. Otherwise, bake until the top is firmer to the touch (about 5 additional minutes). Remove from the oven, and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling. Slice and serve when still slightly warm.\n  Adapted from the recipe for Cinnamon Rolls on page 166 of Gluten-Free on a Shoestring Bakes Bread.

Set aside for 10 minutes before rinsing the chicken off with water. Make sure the baking soda is completely rinsed off. Pat dry the chicken pieces and set aside. Heat up a claypot on high heat and add the dark sesame oil. Add the ginger, garlic, and stir-fry until aromatic. Add in the chicken and do a few quick stirs.

Add the basil leaves and stir well with the chicken, dish out and serve immediately.  Cook\u0026rsquo;s Notes  This recipe calls for dark sesame oil or toasted sesame oil, which is different from regular sesame oil. Dark sesame oil is a lot more expensive but the flavor is more intense and with a stronger toasted sesame fragrance. You can skip the first step of tenderizing the chicken with baking soda. I personally like it because it makes the chicken so tender. If you don’t have a claypot, you can use a regular wok or pan to make this dish.

Roll out pastry to 2mm thick on a Thermomat or silicon mat, with a piece of baking paper on top of dough so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stick to the rolling pin.

Fill ramekins about 3/4 full with filling, and top with pastry circles. Place ramekins onto baking trays, and bake in 180C oven for approx 25 mins, or until browned.  Notes  I prefer to use activated nuts and seeds - soaked and dehydrated - as they are easier to digest. If using activated nuts and seeds for the pastry, and milling them yourself, you will only need about 250g as they are lighter than raw. You can make this NUT FREE by using all pepitas and sunflower seeds instead of almond meal. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have time to make individual pies, you can pour the filling into a large, rectangular baking dish, roll out pastry into a rectangle to fit dish, place on top and bake 25-30 mins, until done.

Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Gradually add the egg, beating just until incorporated. (Don\u0026rsquo;t over mix or the butter will separate and lighten in color.) Add flour and salt and mix just until it forms a ball. (Don\u0026rsquo;t overwork or pastry will be hard when baked.) Flatten dough into disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate about one hour or until firm. Have ready an 8 - 9 inch (20 - 23 cm) tart pan with removable bottom. On a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry into an 12 - 13 inch (30 - 33 cm) circle. To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards to get uniform thickness). When the pastry is the desired size, lightly roll the pastry around your rolling pin, dusting off any excess flour as you roll. Unroll over the top of your tart pan. Never pull your pastry or you will get shrinkage (shrinkage is caused by too much pulling of the pastry when placing it in the pan). Gently press the pastry onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Roll your rolling pin over top of pan to get rid of excess pastry. Prick bottom of pastry with the tines of a fork (this will prevent the pastry from puffing up as it bakes). Cover and refrigerate for about 20 minutes to chill the butter and to rest the gluten. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line the chilled unbaked pastry shell with parchment paper or foil. Fill tart pan with pie weights, rice, or beans, making sure the weights are to the top of the pan and evenly distributed over the entire surface. Bake crust for about 20 minutes or until crust is golden brown around the edges. Remove from oven and remove the parchment paper and weights. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place the crust back into the oven for about 3-5 minutes or until the crust is dry to the touch.  Method - Apricot Glaze  In a small saucepan heat the apricot preserves just until boiling. Remove from heat and strain to get get rid of lumps. Add the Grand Marnier or water. With a pastry brush, brush the glaze over the bottom and sides of the pastry shell. (This seals the crust and prevents it from getting soggy.)  Method - Apple Tart  Spoon the applesauce into the cooled pre-baked tart shell. Peel, core, and cut the apples into 1/4 inch (1/2 cm) slices. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and stir in the 2 - 4 tablespoons (25 - 50 grams) sugar (depending on tartness of apples) and ground cinnamon. Add the apples and saute until they just begin to soften (approximately 3-5 minutes). Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Arrange the apple slices in concentric circles over the applesauce, and brush with about 1 tablespoon (12 grams) melted butter. Place the tart pan on a larger baking sheet and bake the tart for 25 - 30 minutes or until the apples are soft but not mushy. If desired, dust the top of the tart with powdered sugar, cover the edges of tart with foil, and place under a preheated broiler, about 4 inches (10 cm) from the heat, until the edges of the apples are golden brown and crisp. Watch carefully. Once the tart has cooled lightly glaze the apple slices with warm apricot glaze. Serve the tart warm or at room temperature with softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

Tips for Crispy French Fries  You need to cook at a high temp. I ended up at 425 convection. I think convection is important if you are using the rack to not have to flip the fries. The potatoes must be soaked, rinsed and then dried or they will just be a mushy mess. A light coat of oil adds some taste. Put the salt on before you bake. If you put them up on a rack they will brown all around and you do not need to flip them half way through Never overlap fries.

This is a salty pancake so ensure most of the surface has some salt on it. Roll the spiral again according to the size of your pan (I do mine to about 20cm in diameter).

Mix by hand for about 3-4 minutes until the batter is smooth. Do NOT over-mix. Add the oil. Let the crêpe batter rest for at least 2-3 hours (I let it rest overnight). Thin the crêpe batter with about 1/3 cup of water (up to 2/3 cup). Place your crêpe pan (or any flat pan) over medium heat. Grease it with a little butter using a silicone brush. Pour about ½ cup of the batter in the center of the pan. Lift the pan and then tilt and rotate it until the batter is evenly spread and forms a nice thin disk. Put it back on the stove. It should start bubbling after a few seconds. Lower the heat to low. Place a slice of raclette cheese and add a little bit of the button mushroom and red bell pepper filling. Fold the crêpe and let the cheese melt for 1-2 minutes. The traditional method is to fold the edges of the crêpes in on all 4 sides by about 2 to 3 inches; this leaves the filling exposed. Repeat until all the ingredients are used. Stir the crêpe batter as you go for uniform consistency. Serve immediately with apple cider served in stoneware cups or kir (crème de cassis mixed with cider). Bon appétit!  Tips  The longer you let the batter rest the better. It will still be good after 2-3 days in the refrigerator. The first crêpe is never perfect. You might want to thin the batter with more water if the crêpe turns out too thick. The best spatula to flip crêpe is the one from Ikea. It\u0026rsquo;s long, flat, heat resistant and gentle on non-stick pans. And it\u0026rsquo;s inexpensive . If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in making an Asian version, check out my recipe for banh xeo, it\u0026rsquo;s a Vietnamese crêpe. For a vegan version, omit the butter and use only oil instead. I used whole wheat flour for health reasons. You could use all-purpose flour instead (measure 150 grams = 5.3 ounces) but you might want to reduce the amount of liquid.

I love the characteristic holes on top. Those holes are a result of the addition of extra baking soda to the yeast batter. Crumpets are perfect either savory or sweet, and just saying the name sets the perfect mood for a fancy tea party or Sunday brunch.  Ingredients  2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon dry active yeast 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 2 eggs 1 cup whole milk 3/4 cup water, + 2 tablespoons for the yeast 1 tablespoon butter, melted, + extra for greasing the pan 1/2 teaspoon star anise extract 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon extract  Method  In a bowl, combine the flour and baking soda. Sift all the dry ingredients. Heat the water. Using a thermometer, the temperature should be between 105°F to 120°F. In a little bowl, place the yeast, add a teaspoon of sugar then add 2 tablespoons of the warm water. Stir a little so the yeast gets dissolved and let it rest for 10-20 minutes. Warm the milk as well. Set aside. In two bowls, separate the yolks from the egg whites. Reserve the egg white for later. In one bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining sugar using a hand mixer until it\u0026rsquo;s thick and pale yellow. Add the cinnamon and the star anise extracts. Slowly add the dry ingredients one-third at a time, the yeast, the rest of the milk, warm water and butter. Do not overmix the batter. Let the batter stand for about 30-45 minutes. Thoroughly wash the hand mixer blades. Add a pinch of salt to the egg whites then whisk them until soft peaks form. Add 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture then gently stir everything to soften the batter. Pour in the rest of the egg whites and gently fold the egg whites into the egg yolks to get an airy batter. Transfer the batter to a pitcher. Brush a hot flat griddle pan with a little butter using a silicone brush. When the pan is hot, pour about 1 tablespoon of the batter and make 6 crumpets in the griddle pan. Lower the heat to medium-low. The crumpets should start bubbling after a few minutes. Leave them alone. Cook for about 4-5 minutes. When you see the edges start to dry and holes forming, take a spatula and flip the crumpet. The crumpets should cook for about 1-2 minutes until they are slightly golden. Repeat the same procedure. Cook six crumpets at a time until the whole batter is used.  Tips  Sifting dry ingredients helps get rid of nasty lumps of flour and aerates the mixture when liquid is added. It\u0026rsquo;s very important for all your baking so you get a moist result. I use McCormick anise and cinnamon extracts. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have any, you can use star anise seeds: dry roast them and grind them finely in a mortar and pestle. You can use cinnamon powder as well. This recipe yields about 50 2-inch mini-crumpets but you can definitely make them larger. I just like making bite-size appetizers. You can either serve them as a sweet or a savory dish. I think the best way is just with a generous layer of butter.

Once the water is hot (barely a simmer), sit a larger sized bowl on top of the sauce pan to melt the lip balm ingredients in, or a large ceramic cup or glass measuring cup directly into the water. If you\u0026rsquo;re putting it directly in the water, take care to use an oven mitt when handling it. While the water is warming up, carefully set all the empty lip balm tubes in an area close by and make sure the lids are removed. Once the mixture is melted you have to fill the containers quickly before it re-solidifies. Using a grater, shred 3 tablespoons worth of beeswax. If you\u0026rsquo;re using the beeswax pastilles, you can skip this step. Place the beeswax into whatever container you\u0026rsquo;re going to use to melt the mixture (measuring cup, mixing bowl, etc.), then measure in the olive oil and cocoa or shea butter. Place the container either over or directly in the water on low heat and wait for it to gently melt. Once it\u0026rsquo;s completely melted (no beeswax solids remaining), turn off the heat and set the pan aside. Quickly add the vitamin E oil, honey, and essential oil (a little goes a long way), then give it one last stir. Using the transfer pipette or another form of dropper, carefully fill all the empty lip balm tubes with the mixture. If the mixture starts solidifying in the container, simply reheat it on low until it returns to liquid. When all the lip balm tubes are filled and the mixture used up, I recommend placing all the dishes/utensils you used in some hot water in the sink so that the beeswax doesn\u0026rsquo;t solidify on them. It\u0026rsquo;ll be easier to clean that way. Set the lip balm tubes aside and let them cool for 2-3 hours. Cap and use within a few months.  Notes  Homemade lip balm made with extra virgin olive oil, beeswax, cocoa butter, vitamin E oil, local honey, and 100% pure therapeutic-grade peppermint essential oil. This is an inexpensive DIY project you can make at home in about 15 minutes, and they make great gifts for guys and gals! If you\u0026rsquo;re not a big fan of peppermint, try lavender essential oil (just for starters). Citrus essential oils are popular for lip balms (lemon, orange, lime, grapefruit, etc.); however, they can increase photosensitivity (make it easier for your skin to burn in the sun), so be cautious of using them in your beauty products during the summer, or if you live in a sunny area.

Shave off the required amount of cocoa butter using a spoon (it should crumble with gentle pressure) and measure into a glass measuring cup or large ceramic mug along with the coconut oil. Place the cup or mug in the water (creating a makeshift double boiler) to gently melt the cocoa butter and coconut oil. Once all solids have dissolved (do not let it come to a boil), remove the container from the water and let it cool for 10-15 minutes. Test the mixture with your finger. Once it\u0026rsquo;s barely lukewarm (it may take another 10 minutes of cooling), stir in the jojoba oil and desired amount of essential oils. Start with a smaller amount, smell it, then add more. Let your nose be the guide. Pour the mixture into a stainless steel mixing bowl (your stand mixer should come with one) and place in the freezer for 15-20 minutes. You want the body butter to begin solidifying, but not completely. It must be cold in order to whip properly. If you\u0026rsquo;re using some other type of bowl or your freezer isn\u0026rsquo;t as cold, it may need to hang out in there longer. When it has solidified partly, remove from the freezer and whip on medium to medium-high power in your stand mixer with a wire whisk until it is the consistency of butter. You will need to take a break every few minutes to scrape down the sides. I think mine took about 4-5 minutes to do this. Transfer to a container (like a glass mason jar) and store in the fridge until it has firmed up. If it\u0026rsquo;s wintertime, or cold in your region, you can store it on the counter.  Notes  As long as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come in contact with water, it should last three to six months; however if it starts to smell funky or look weird\u0026ndash;toss it! You can always make more. :) If your home is especially warm (or it\u0026rsquo;s summertime), you will need to put the body butter in the fridge immediately to keep it from melting. If the body butter melts, don\u0026rsquo;t fret! Simply stick it back in the fridge or freezer until it starts to solidify again and re-whip. This recipe recommends a bit more essential oil than my normal DIY projects because cocoa butter has an strong, prominent scent (like chocolate). In order to smell the essential oils, you\u0026rsquo;ll need more than usual. If you use shea butter instead, you may be able to use less. Coconut oil turns into liquid at 76 degrees or higher, so if you change the ratio in this recipe to incorporate more coconut oil, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely have to keep it in the fridge during warmer months. If you want to make a larger batch to give out as gifts, feel free to double this recipe; however, keep in mind that a little body butter goes a long way so your friends and family won\u0026rsquo;t need much! To make it look pretty when you\u0026rsquo;re portioning it into containers, squeeze it through a piping bag or a plastic freezer bag with the corner cut off.

It will take a couple of minutes. Here it is after 60 seconds. Just stir well after each interval. Below is what it will look like when it is completely melted. Cut the tip off of the vitamin E capsule and add it to your liquid mixture. Add lemon and lime essential oils, to your liking. As a reference, I used about 15 drops of each. Stir after adding the oils. If your mixture is lightly scented, add a few more drops and give it another whiff. If it smells just right, add a couple of more drops as it sometimes seems to lose potency when it has hardened. Pour your mixture into your moulds. Allow to sit until tops start to look solid (about 15 minutes). Carefully move to the refrigerator and allow to set completely, about 30 minutes. Pop your lotion bars out of the moulds. 2 oz. of bees wax will make a nice firm bar. If you’d like a softer bar that reacts to the heat of your skin quicker, you can lower the amount of bees wax to 1.5 oz. or even 1 oz. The beauty of the melt and pour method is that if you don’t like the consistency you can change it! If it is too hard, re-melt it and add a more coconut oil or shea butter and let it set up again. If it is too soft for you liking, add a little more beeswax. It’s completely up to you. Just use my measurements as a starting point. To use, wrap your fingers around your bar. The warmth from your skin will activate the oils and leave a soft and smooth residue. A little bit goes a long way. Rub into your hands and allow it to absorb. Your hands will thank you!

Once oils are melted, remove from heat and refrigerate. {Do not place in freezer!} Once the oils appear opaque, remove from fridge and using a stand or hand mixer whip. The oils will get creamy fast. Once oils are creamy, refrigerate for 5 minutes, and then continue to whip again. Add in essential oils, and whip until you get stiff peaks. Separate into two bowls, and colour one with the red colorant. Using a spoon or piping bag, add a layer of white body butter, then red, alternating until container is full.

Mash in the butter until it’s completely incorporated. Stir in the eggs one at a time, along with the rum and almond extract. (The mixture may not look completely smooth, which is normal.) Cover and chill. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. On lightly floured surface, roll one piece of puff pastry into a circle about 9 1/2-inches (23cm) round. Using a pot lid, plate, or bottom of springform pan as a template, trim the dough into neat circle. Place the dough on the baking sheet. Cover it with a sheet of parchment paper or plastic film, then roll the other piece of dough into a circle, trim it, and lay it on top. Chill the dough for thirty minutes. Remove the dough and almond filling from the refrigerator. Slide the second circle of dough and parchment or plastic from pan so that there is only one circle of dough on the parchment lined baking sheet. Spread the almond filling over the center of the dough, leaving a 1-inch (3cm) exposed border. Place an almond or piece of candied fruit to act as the fève (prize) somewhere in the almond filling, if you wish. Brush water generously around the exposed perimeter of the dough then place the other circle of dough on top of the galette and press down to seal the edges very well. (At this point, you may wish to chill the galette since it’ll be a bit easier to finish and decorate, although it’s not necessary. It can be refrigerated overnight at this point, if you wish.) To bake the galette, preheat the oven to 375ºF (180ºC.) Flute the sides of the dough (as shown in the photo) and use a paring knife to create a design on top. Stir together the egg yolk with the milk and brush it evenly over the top – avoid getting the glaze on the sides, which will inhibit the pastry from rising at the edges. Use a paring knife to poke 5 holes in the top, to allow steam escape while baking. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the galette is browned on top and up the sides. (During baking, if the galette puffs up too dramatically in the oven, you may want to poke it once or twice again with a paring knife to release the steam.) Remove from the oven and slide the galette off the baking sheet and onto a cooling rack. The galette will deflate as it cools, which is normal. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Method  Prepare Ingredients: ensure your cashews have soaked for at least an hour and are rinsed before starting. Peel the lemon and cut in half (optionally you can first grate the skin and retain zest for sprinkling on chips later). Remove stem and seed from pepper and chop into quarters. Wash and dry kale in a salad spinner. Remove the thickest part of the stems. Tear the leaves into smaller pieces as shown in photos below. Place the cleaned and prepared kale leaves in your kitchen’s largest mixing bowl. Prepare two cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper and keep these close to your work area. Turn on oven to its lowest setting (about 70°C-80°C or 160°F-180°F) Put cashews, yeast flakes, pepper, garlic, oil, soy sauce, peeled lemon (chili flakes if using) into Thermomix bowl. Process 1 minute/speed 8. Carefully remove lid and using spatula push sauce down from sides of bowl and lid. Process again 1 minute/speed 8. Roll up sleeves because now the messy fun is about to start! Pour sauce onto kale in the large bowl. Use hands to massage and smush the sauce into the kale so leaves are completely coated. Stand back and admire your work. Resist temptation to lick hands. Use messy hands to place kale pieces on prepared trays ensuring there is only one layer of kale on each tray. Kale pieces should not overlap if possible so try to distribute evenly. (Here you may choose to add an optional sprinkling of salt, sesame seeds, and/or lemon zest.) As with comedy, so with kale chips: “Timing is everything!” Set kitchen timer for 4 hours. At half-way point remove trays and turn over each leaf. Notice they have started to shrink. They will appear cheezy and limp. Don’t even think about tasting now or you will be disappointed. Return trays to oven and continue baking for two more hours. The goal is to ‘dry’ them, rather than ‘roast’ them. After four hours your chips should appear dry and crispy. Do not let them get too crispy as they can quickly begin to burn. (To test, lift one off the parchment and check if it is stiff.) Allow chips to cool on trays. Prepare for the unexpected. Enjoy!  Variations  This is a very forgiving recipe I have done many substitutions with varying success: cream cheese instead of cashews, a whole peeled orange instead of lemon juice, balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice, sea salt instead of soy sauce, coriander, oyster sauce, parmesan etc. Try if first as shown above and then play with the recipe to suit yourself.

Scent #1  Oranges, cinnamon \u0026amp; cloves (allspice and anise are optional). This scent carries into multiple rooms better, and it can be reheated to scent your rooms for several days.  Scent #2  Lemon, rosemary, \u0026amp; vanilla. It has a lovely freshness to it.  Scent #3  Lime, thyme, mint \u0026amp; vanilla extract. This combination has such a fresh, pleasant scent. I initially made it without the mint extract, but have found that it really kicks up the aroma.  Scent #4  Orange, ginger (fresh or powdered), and almond extract. This is a sweet, delicious scent.  Scent #5  Pine or cedar twigs (or other fragrant twigs), bay leaves, and nutmeg. These scents combine for a complex aroma. If you have whole nutmeg, use a microplane to grate off the outer surface\u0026ndash;this will release the scent. Add the whole nutmeg piece along with the gratings.  How to heat the mixture   Uncovered Slow Cooker Method. This is my personal favorite. I use a mini slow cooker\u0026ndash;the kind made for keeping dips and sauces warm. Mine only has one low heat setting. The mixture never actually bubbles and visibly steams. I leave it uncovered on my kitchen counter to slowly release scent throughout the day. It\u0026rsquo;s subtle, but creates a pleasant smell in my kitchen and a hint of scent in surrounding rooms. When I\u0026rsquo;m home, I keep my mini slow cooker going. It\u0026rsquo;s easy and uses very little electricity. When I fill mine in the morning, it won\u0026rsquo;t dry out for an entire day. If you\u0026rsquo;re concerned about accidentally letting it run dry, you can put a lamp timer on it so that it automatically shuts off at the desired time. I put a scented jar mixture in the microwave for 2 minutes to get it really hot before I add it to the slow cooker. That gives it a jump start on releasing the scent.\n  NOTE: For a stronger scent, simply double or triple the recipe in a larger, full-size slow cooker and set it on high.\n  Refer to the URL link for more cooking methods.\n  ",url:"https://jarodl.am/cookbook/archive/natural_home_scents/"},"https:\/\/jarodl.am\/cookbook\/archive\/potato_and_vegetable_puree\/":{title:"Potato and Vegetable Puree",content:"Ingredients  600g water 650g potatoes, floury, cut into pieces 350g vegetables, eg carrots, cut into pieces 200g milk 1/2tsp salt 1 pinch nutmeg 30g butter  Method  Place water into MC bowl, insert simmering basket and weigh potatoes into it.

It is a high protein meal that contains good quantities of calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron and zinc, and is rich in the amino acid lysine as well. Its low GI of 25 helps maintain stable blood sugar levels. It adds a sweet, nutty taste with a hint of caramel, and can be added to smoothies and other drinks, to jellies, and to baking (breads, pancakes, muffins, cakes and cookies). When used in baking, the mesquite bean powder/flour is used in combination with other flours – substitute ¼ cup-to-½ cup mesquite flour in each cup grain flour.

The trick is all in the presentation! If you\u0026rsquo;re on the look out for ways to sneak those leafy green veggies into your child\u0026rsquo;s (or your own!) diet than this recipe by Chris Anca of Tales of a Kitchen will be very well received! A creamy green smoothie with spinach, fresh mango, banana, cashew milk, ginger, vanilla, and a dash of green tea powder forms the actual base of a deliciously fruity cake. Agar, a thickener derived from algae, is added to help things set properly. Serve it with a sprinkling of macadamia shavings and fresh mint leaves to garnish.  Ingredients - for smoothie  A handful of fresh spinach 2 medium-small mango fruits 1 banana 1 cup cashew milk (or other nut milk of choice) 2 cm piece of ginger 1 tsp matcha green tea 1 tbl sweetener of choice (honey / maple syrup) 4 tbl lemon juice pinch vanilla powder 1 cup water  Ingredients - for base of cake  ½ cup crushed almonds 3 Medjool dates  Ingredients - for filling of cake  1 cup of the smoothie  ⅔ tsp agar agar + ½ cup water\nMethod  Add all the ingredients for the smoothie to a blender and blitz until you get a smooth concoction. Reserve 1 cup of the smoothie in a bowl and enjoy drinking the rest. To make the base of the cake, simply mix the dates with the crushed almonds. It can easily be done by hand. Press the mix into a your chosen cake shape, lined with cling film. To make the filling, add the water with the agar agar to low heat and stir with a whisk until it begins to thicken. It doesn’t need to get to a boil. Once it begins to slightly thicken (should be around a minute), remove from heat and continue to stir for another minute. Add the agar agar mix to the smoothie in the bowl and swiftly mix it through with a whisk. Add the cake filling to the base and place in the fridge.  Can be served in as little as 10 minutes.\n Serve chilled.

Add your mince to the breadcrumbs and mix well to incorporate (I use clean hands for this job). To the rest of the onions in the TM bowl, add a can of tomatoes, tomato paste, stock concentrate and wine. Cook for 15 minutes, Varoma, Speed 2. Whilst the sauce is cooking you can form the meatballs. I browned my meatballs quickly over a hotplate and I usually do this in the same dish I am going to bake them in, such as a flameproof/ovenproof dish (not the glass dish as shown). Pour the tomato sauce over the meatballs and bake 150 degress for 35 minutes in the oven. Meanwhile cook the brown rice in the Thermomix as per instructions, and prepare a salad (or steam veges in the last 8 minutes of the rice cooking). I grated some cheese in my TM bowl and sprinkled on top of the hot meatballs to let it melt. Voila, dinner is done.  Options  Meatballs can be steamed in the Varoma tray whilst cooking the tomato sauce. Cook sauce and meatballs for 25 minutes, on Varoma, Speed 2. To ensure the meatballs cook through make sure they aren\u0026rsquo;t too large. If you wish to include more vegetables in the dish you can add vegetables to the meatballs or the pasta sauce. I usually chop eggplant, zucchini and carrot on Speed 8 and add to the meatball mixture or add some spinach and capsicum to the pasta sauce (add to the onion mixture and chop on speed 5). Now you have the veges covered. Try using lamb mince spiced with ground cumin along with fresh coriander and mint for a more middle eastern flavoured dish. Serve with couscous.

Dough Ingredients  500g plain flour 350g boiling water  Method  Place the flour into the Thermomix bowl, mix on speed 5 for 10 seconds to lighten and aerate it slightly. Add boiling water and mix on speed 5 for 6 seconds. Then set to closed lid position and knead on interval speed for 2 minutes. Transfer to the Thermomat or a bowl to rest for approx 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Using one part at a time, roll into a log and cut into 8 equal pieces. Take one piece and roll into a very thin round, using a rolling pin. I am not an expert getting it perfectly round with a rolling pin, here is a link to a youtube tutorial on how to do it, which I struggled with, so I cheated and got my perfect circle with a large glass! I found keeping a slightly damp tea towel over the dough kept it from drying out.  Filling Ingredients  2 garlic cloves 2 spring onionssmall handful fresh chives 300g wombok 500g chicken mince  Method  Place garlic, spring onions and chives into TM bowl, chop on speed 6 for 5 sec. Add wombok and chop on speed 4 for 3 seconds (don’t do it for too long or it will turn to purée quickly!). Add mince, mix to combine on reverse speed 4 for 20 sec, use spatula through the lid to help combine the ingredients. Place a spoonful of the mince mixture into the middle of a circle and bring the edges together at the top and press firmly together, pleat one of the sides as you join them together. Here is a video link on how to pleat the dumplings. Place in the Varoma dish and tray ready for steaming. Keep a little bit of space between them so they don’t stick. Once the Varoma is full, fill the TM bowl with 900ml of water and steam the dumplings on Varoma temp for 15 min speed 2.  Dumplings  To cook the dumplings on the stove, bring a large pot of water to the boil. When boiling, add some of the dumplings (don’t over crowd the pot). They will sink to the bottom, then rise to the top. Add approx 1 cup of cold water when they rise to the surface. Continue boiling until the dumplings become translucent. Remove with a slotted spoon. Continue this same method until all are cooked in batches.  Dipping Sauce Ingredients  10 saffron threads 2 tablespoons of boiling water 2 tablespoons Rice malt syrup 1 tablespoon carob syrup 1 clove garlic, minced 1/2 Shallot, thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon rock salt, ground  Method  Place the saffron threads into a small bowl. Add the hot water and set aside for a few minutes. Mix the remaining dipping sauce ingredients together and stir well to combine. Add the saffron and water. Store in the fridge until ready to use.  Chive Pancakes Ingredients  Dumpling Dough Spray oil 3 eggs Pinch of garlic salt fresh chives, chopped  Method  Using any of the left over dough that has been prepared exactly the same way as the dumplings, rolled out thinly in a small round circle. Beat the eggs together with garlic salt. Heat up a non stick frying pan, spray with oil. Brush one side of the dough with beaten egg, sprinkle with chives and place egg side down in the pan. Brush the top side with egg while it’s cooking and sprinkle with chives. Allow to cook for a few minutes until lightly browned and the egg is cooked, flip over and cook the other side.

Heat a dry ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat and lightly toast the pine nuts until they are just tinged brown. Remove from the pan and put to one side for a moment.\n  Break the eggs into a large mixing bowl, then crumble in the feta cheese and grate in the Cheddar.

Rub some olive oil over the sheets, then sprinkle over a pinch of cayenne pepper and season lightly. Repeat until you have 3 layers of filo.\n  Being very careful, move the greaseproof paper and filo over to the empty ovenproof frying pan so the edges flop over the top. Push the pastry down into the sides of the pan.\n  Pour the egg mixture into the pan and spread it out.\n  Fold over the edges of the filo pastry back over so that they completely cover the egg mixture. Don’t worry about making it look pretty; the more rough the folds, the more lovely crispy filo you will have. Trim back some of the greaseproof paper.\n  Put the pan back on the medium heat for a few minutes to start the bottom of pie cooking, then put the pan in the oven for 20 minutes or so until golden and crisp.\n  Remove from the oven and serve in slices with salad.

(I’m saying this from personal experience!)  Ingredients  1 litre lite OR Full cream milk 50g Milk powder (not essential – refer to Q\u0026amp;A on page 3 of this doc) 3 tbsp pot set Natural Yoghurt (this is your ‘starter’ – use a reputable brand of natural Greek Yoghurt for your first batch) eg: Jalna, Mundella, Farmers Union, Chris’s, Aldi/Woolies/Coles Greek yoghurt.  Method  Pour milk and powdered milk into TM bowl and blend for 10 seconds on speed 7. Cook for 30 minutes at 90 degrees on speed THREE (if cooked on speed 1 you will get a burnt film of milk on the bottom of your bowl – which does comes off quite easily after soaking using the Thermomix spatula) – however if cooked on speed 3 there is nothing left on the bottom! Place TM bowl into fridge for approx 40 mins to drop the temp down to 37 degrees. (put a timer on so you don’t forget!) Or somewhere cool but it will take a lot longer to cool down. When the 40 minutes is up – turn your Thermomix back on – place TM bowl on to unit and the temperature light should light up on the 37 or 50 degrees. If it lights up on 50 degrees or higher – put bowl back in fridge for another 15 or so minutes. Then take out and test again. The 37 degree temp is crucial for the yoghurt to be a success. You need to wait for the 37 light to go OUT so you know it is no hotter than 37. The bowl will be warm to your hands, but not hot, as 37 is normal body temperature. If you accidentally forget it in the fridge and it gets way below 37 – don’t worry just put it back on to heat up again for say 5 mins, 37 degrees speed 3. Once you see the light come on at 37 degrees you can then stop it. (I say 5 minutes (number just picked out of my head) as you need to have a time set in order for the temperature to work). (Remember the rule of TIME, TEMPERATURE, SPEED). Once at 37degrees add the 3 tbsp pot set natural yoghurt and mix for 4 seconds on speed 4. Cook for 10 minutes at 37 degrees on speed THREE – (if cooked on speed 1 you will get a burnt film of milk on the bottom of your bowl). At this time pre warm your Thermoserver with boiling water from the kettle. When the 10 minutes of cooking is finished – drain your water filled Thermoserver – then pour the cooked milk from the TM bowl into your pre-warmed Thermoserver. I then wrap my Thermoserver in a thick towel or blanket (baby blankets are great) to keep warm for a minimum of 6 hours (leave it somewhere in the house where it will be left undisturbed) – it can actually be left up to 24 hours! (The longer you leave it the thicker it gets). After the minimum of 6 hours I then take the lid off the Thermoserver and Voila I have yoghurt! I can honestly say it still NEVER ceases to amaze me the chemical reaction of what cooking milk and leaving it does – it still does my head in every single time! Amazing! I then pour the yoghurt into a Tupperware container and also reserving 3 tablespoons into a smaller container to keep to use as my starter for my next batch. Trust me – Your yoghurt WILL get thicker and creamier the more frequently you make it using your own starter from each batch.

Vanilla Yoghurt (sweetened) Ingredients  1.5ltr Full Cream Milk 50g Raw Sugar 20g Vanilla Extract 100- 200ml Yoghurt Starter  Method  Simply add sugar and Vanilla during initial heating process, I have used Vanilla beans which are split to release bean flavour more, but find a lot of the vanilla is wasted as it floats, therefore when you remove any ‘skin’ during the milk cooling the Vanilla is lost.  Honey Yoghurt Ingredients  1.5ltr Full Cream Milk 85g Honey 100- 200ml Yoghurt Starter  Method  Add the honey during the heating process, this does taste very sweet in the milk, but as the yogurt thickens it mellows out, but sweetness is relative so adjust to taste.  Bitter Orange Coulis/Compote  This originated from being asked for an Orange Jam recipe and I loved the result served with my yogurt and so did the kids. I do not put as much sugar in this coulis as I did the jam though. The recipe can be adapted for any fruit of choice, so I have given two versions to play around with!  Ingredients  Zest of half an Orange (optional) 500g Orange peel and pith cut off 100g Raw Sugar  Method  Place zest and sugar in TM bowl and mill for 10 -15 sec, speed 9. Scrape down and give a little longer if necessary Add orange flesh, with any visible pips removed. Pulverise 8 secs speed 9, then cook for 20mins, Varoma temp, speed 1 with MC off (keep an eye as may boil up into top well, you can always drop temp to 100 degrees for a while) Once cooked transfer to a container to cool before marbelling through yogurt or adding a spoonful as required. Recipe should yield approx 300g  Mixed fruit Coulis/compote  This is basically the same as the above but I have used frozen mixed berries, but you could try it with any seasonal produce and you will probably get a good result.  Ingredients  150g Sugar Zest and Juice of 1 Lemon (optional depending on pectin content) 500g Frozen Mixed Berries  Method  Method is exactly the same as above, but I found the yield slightly higher which maybe because I replaced the MC in last 5 – 10 mins (can’t remember why!).You can play with the consistency by adjusting the temp between 100 degree’s and varoma, obviously the more varoma time the thicker it will become, test on a plate of chilled water to see how it holds.

Ensure that the beans are cooked at 80 degrees for at least 2 minutes. Blend for 1 minute on speed 8 until smooth and creamy. Add remaining water, pandan leaves and sugar and cook for 6 minutes at 90 degrees on speed 2-3. Towards the end of cooking, keep an eye on it to ensure that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t boil over. Cool, strain through a calico cloth or nut bag and serve warm or cold. This is meant to be drunk as a beverage but can also be used on cereal or as a milk substitute (in which case you may prefer to not add pandan leaves and sugar).  Top  I have used the other TM method for making soya milk, but always found that there was a slightly bitter aftertaste. I researched the reason why and discovered that the soy beans need to be cooked to approx 82 degrees before being blended to avoid the bitterness and \u0026lsquo;beany\u0026rsquo; taste. By using this method, there is also less likelihood of the milk boiling or foaming over. If the milk does start to boil over, turn off for a few seconds and then on again. You need to complete the cooking process. If using organic soya beans there is no need to change the soaking water more than once. If you\u0026rsquo;re not used to \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; soya milk, you can make it taste more like the commercial stuff by adding vanilla, malt, oats or barley (during cooking process). I\u0026rsquo;m not sure in what quantities as I\u0026rsquo;m happy drinking the real, unalterated soya milk. The left over pulp is called okara and has several uses, but is quite bland and grainy. Use it in your worm farm or bokashi bucket.

(Serving suggestion)  Ingredients  280 g. water or milk (or combination thereof) 1 tbsp granulated yeast (instant or regular) 25 g. oil 500 g. flour 2 tsp. salt corn meal (optional, for spreading on baking sheet)  Method  Put water/milk, and oil into Thermomix bowl and mix for 30 seconds/37°C/speed 1. Add yeast and mix for 5 seconds/speed 3. Add flour and salt and mix for 6 seconds/speed 8. Knead dough for 2 minutes on interval speed. Remove dough, form into a ball, and place into a slightly greased bowl or baking mat to rise till doubled (about 30-60 minutes, depending on yeast type used.) See additional tip about rising below. Divide dough in half (for two large pizzas, or into four if making smaller individual sized pizzas) and allow dough to rest for 15 minutes and then form into pizza shape using hands and/or rolling pin before fitting it to the baking pan or pizza stone. (See additional tip about cornmeal below) Add toppings of choice and bake in a hot oven at about 220°C (425°F) for about 20 minutes. Timing will depend on toppings used.  Notes (from the author)  about rising dough: if you are a beginning cook and unsure about making dough rise, here is a tip I read somewhere online. When dough is removed from Thermomix bowl, pinch off a small ball of dough, the size of a marble, and put it into a glass of water. When the ball of dough rises to the surface of the water, it means your yeast has proved and your dough is ready for the next step. (I tried this in the photos above and it worked!) about corn meal: I always sprinkle a small handfull of cornmeal to the baking pan before stretching the dough into shape. This adds a nice, ever-so-slight crunchy texture to the bottom of the pizza and helps keep it from sticking to the pan. about storing dough: If this batch of dough is more than you need in one day, wrap the extra in cling film and store in fridge until the next day. Knead for 30 seconds to re-awaken the dough before using.

Place bases onto prepared trays and top with even amounts of reserved Parmesan, mozzarella and potatoes, sprinkle with fresh rosemary, season with salt and pepper and drizzle lightly with oil. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until pizzas are light golden and topping is bubbling, then remove pizzas from the oven, top each with an even amount of sliced bocconcini and return to the hot oven for a further 3-5 minutes to crisp up and slightly melt the bocconcini. Slice and serve hot.  Tips  Serve Pizza bianca with potato and rosemary hot with a side salad for a quick and easy dinner or allow to cool before placing in the refrigerator to serve, re-heated, for lunch the next day. This is a traditional pizza topping in Italy, particularly common in the colder winter months. You can substitute some ingredients with others you may already have in your pantry; most varieties of potatoes will work so feel free to use up what you already have, you can even try with sweet potato or substitute potato with zucchini if you have some. Spelt flour can be substituted with bakers flour, and slices of mozzarella can be used instead of bocconcini balls. You can also add extra flavours like wilted spinach, bacon, prosciutto, mushrooms, olives or red onion to create your own variations. The pizza dough can be made in advance and frozen until ready to use. Be sure to fully defrost the dough before using it.

If the pastry becomes warm while you are working with it, it will tear easily. Place it back in the refrigerator,if required. Biscuits are fragile when hot.  Variation  To make the pineapple-shaped Pineapple tarts, follow above preparation up to stage 4, rolling out the pastry to 2 – 3mm thickness. Cut pastry using a cup or glass about 12cm in diameter. With the pastry circle flat on your fingers, place a 2cm ball of pineapple filling in the centre and curl your fingers inwards to make the pastry encase the filling. Make sure the pastry seam (opening) is on the bottom, press down on the pastry to flatten it slightly, then seal the ends and trim to make a small pineapple-shaped oval. Score the top of the tart with a sharp paring knife, 4- 5 diagonal lines in both directions for the ‘pineapple effect’ and brush the top with the egg wash. Bake and store as above.

In a large bowl, combine the shredded cabbage, carrot, scallions, katsuobushi, and all-purpose flour, tossing with two large forks or your fingers to distribute everything evenly. Add the eggs and dashi, and whisk together until the everything is uniformly incorporated. If you want to add other filling ingredients, this is the time to do it. Decide whether your additions will incorporate better into the dry ingredients or wet ingredients and mix them in accordingly. Pour the wet ingredients into the cabbage mixture and stir together until all the cabbage has been moistened and there are no large lumps of flour, but be careful not to overmix. It\u0026rsquo;s fine if there are still some small clumps of flour. Lay out the bacon in a cold pan, overlapping slightly to account for shrinkage. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t using bacon, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to add a few teaspoons of vegetable oil to the pan. Add a third of the cabbage mixture into a mound on top of the bacon. Press down on the mound using a spatula to flatten out the top and then push the edges back towards the center to make a round pancake that\u0026rsquo;s roughly the same thickness from edge to edge (it should be about 3/4-inch thick).

If you are unsure about your flipping abilities, lightly oil and preheat a second pan, then you can use the second pan to cover the first and flip the okonomiyaki straight into the second pan using oven mitts to hold the hot pans. Press down on the top of the okonomiyaki with a spatula and cook uncovered until the second side is browned as well (about 7 minutes).
