<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup of cocoa butter OR shea butter</li>
<li>1/4 cup of coconut oil</li>
<li>1/4 cup of jojoba oil</li>
<li>20-40 drops of your favourite essential oils</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fill a small saucepan 1/4-1/2 way with water and heat over medium low. Shave off the required amount of cocoa butter using a spoon (it should crumble with gentle pressure) and measure into a glass measuring cup or large ceramic mug along with the coconut oil.</li>
<li>Place the cup or mug in the water (creating a makeshift double boiler) to gently melt the cocoa butter and coconut oil. Once all solids have dissolved (do not let it come to a boil), remove the container from the water and let it cool for 10-15 minutes.</li>
<li>Test the mixture with your finger. Once it&rsquo;s barely lukewarm (it may take another 10 minutes of cooling), stir in the jojoba oil and desired amount of essential oils. Start with a smaller amount, smell it, then add more. Let your nose be the guide.</li>
<li>Pour the mixture into a stainless steel mixing bowl (your stand mixer should come with one) and place in the freezer for 15-20 minutes. You want the body butter to begin solidifying, but not completely. It must be cold in order to whip properly. If you&rsquo;re using some other type of bowl or your freezer isn&rsquo;t as cold, it may need to hang out in there longer.</li>
<li>When it has solidified partly, remove from the freezer and whip on medium to medium-high power in your stand mixer with a wire whisk until it is the consistency of butter. You will need to take a break every few minutes to scrape down the sides. I think mine took about 4-5 minutes to do this.</li>
<li>Transfer to a container (like a glass mason jar) and store in the fridge until it has firmed up. If it&rsquo;s wintertime, or cold in your region, you can store it on the counter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>As long as it doesn&rsquo;t come in contact with water, it should last three to six months; however if it starts to smell funky or look weird&ndash;toss it! You can always make more. :)</li>
<li>If your home is especially warm (or it&rsquo;s summertime), you will need to put the body butter in the fridge immediately to keep it from melting.</li>
<li>If the body butter melts, don&rsquo;t fret! Simply stick it back in the fridge or freezer until it starts to solidify again and re-whip.</li>
<li>This recipe recommends a bit more essential oil than my normal DIY projects because cocoa butter has an strong, prominent scent (like chocolate). In order to smell the essential oils, you&rsquo;ll need more than usual. If you use shea butter instead, you may be able to use less.</li>
<li>Coconut oil turns into liquid at 76 degrees or higher, so if you change the ratio in this recipe to incorporate more coconut oil, you&rsquo;ll likely have to keep it in the fridge during warmer months.</li>
<li>If you want to make a larger batch to give out as gifts, feel free to double this recipe; however, keep in mind that a little body butter goes a long way so your friends and family won&rsquo;t need much!</li>
<li>To make it look pretty when you&rsquo;re portioning it into containers, squeeze it through a piping bag or a plastic freezer bag with the corner cut off.</li>
