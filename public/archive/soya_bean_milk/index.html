  <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>100 grams dried soya beans soaked in water overnight or at least 6 hours, (change the soaking water at least once and do a final rinse with fresh water</li>
<li>1 litre water</li>
<li>60 grams Chinese rock sugar or raw sugar</li>
<li>2-3 pandan leaves, (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Place drained beans and 500 grams of water into Closed lid and cook for 6 minutes at 80 degrees counter-clockwise operation on speed 1-2. Ensure that the beans are cooked at 80 degrees for at least 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Blend for 1 minute on speed 8 until smooth and creamy.</li>
<li>Add remaining water, pandan leaves and sugar and cook for 6 minutes at 90 degrees on speed 2-3. Towards the end of cooking, keep an eye on it to ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t boil over.</li>
<li>Cool, strain through a calico cloth or nut bag and serve warm or cold. This is meant to be drunk as a beverage but can also be used on cereal or as a milk substitute (in which case you may prefer to not add pandan leaves and sugar).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="top">Top</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have used the other TM method for making soya milk, but always found that there was a slightly bitter aftertaste. I researched the reason why and discovered that the soy beans need to be cooked to approx 82 degrees before being blended to avoid the bitterness and &lsquo;beany&rsquo; taste.</li>
<li>By using this method, there is also less likelihood of the milk boiling or foaming over. If the milk does start to boil over, turn off for a few seconds and then on again. You need to complete the cooking process.</li>
<li>If using organic soya beans there is no need to change the soaking water more than once.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re not used to &lsquo;real&rsquo; soya milk, you can make it taste more like the commercial stuff by adding vanilla, malt, oats or barley (during cooking process). I&rsquo;m not sure in what quantities as I&rsquo;m happy drinking the real, unalterated soya milk.</li>
<li>The left over pulp is called okara and has several uses, but is quite bland and grainy. Use it in your worm farm or bokashi bucket.</li>
