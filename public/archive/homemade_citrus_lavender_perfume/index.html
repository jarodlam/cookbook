  <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 tsp beeswax</li>
<li>2 tsp carrier oil – sweet almond oil or jojoba oil</li>
<li>48 drops essential oils - 12 drops each of lemon, sweet orange, bergamot &amp; lavender essential oils</li>
<li>Old lip balm tin (the size I used was 1/2 ounce)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s definitely a good idea to blend the essential oils first before you start working with the beeswax because it hardens really, really fast. I put all of my essential oils into one cup so that I could just pour them into the beeswax mixture when the time came. The recipe from Mrs. Child’s book calls for equal parts of each essential oil.</li>
<li>I decided to use sweet almond oil for my carrier oil because I had some on hand and it seemed more authentic to the period of this recipe. I’ve seen several mentions of almond oil in 19th century books and magazines, but I’ve never seen a mention of jojoba oil. If you don’t have almond oil available, though, jojoba oil would work just as well.</li>
<li>In a separate cup from the essential oils, I measured out two teaspoons of almond oil. Measuring the oil out ahead of time saves you from rushing around once your beeswax is melted.</li>
<li>If you have beeswax pellets, simple measure out 2 tsp and melt them in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.</li>
<li>If you have a solid block of beeswax, I’ve found that the best way to get the two teaspoons of beeswax was to grate off about a tablespoon of shavings, melt them in a saucepan at medium-low heat, and then measure to make sure I had two teaspoons. After measuring, I found that I had to heat the beeswax back up in the pan again for a few more seconds because it had started to harden after I poured it into my measuring spoon.</li>
<li>If you find that you don’t have quite two teaspoons, you can just shave off a bit more beeswax and add it to the pot. If you have more than two teaspoons, just save the extra for another project.</li>
<li>Once you have two teaspoons of melted beeswax, add the two teaspoons of carrier oil to the pot and stir around a bit until they are combined. Then take the pot off the burner and quickly (quickly!) add in the essential oils. Stir for just a bit until combined.</li>
<li>As quickly as possible, pour the mixture into your container. Cover it, let it rest for about 10 minutes until it is set, and then enjoy!</li>
