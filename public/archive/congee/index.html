  <h3 id="winnies-simplified-version">Winnie&rsquo;s simplified version</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add 200g rice to TMX bowl and mill for 5 secs/sp 9.</li>
<li>Add a small piece of roughly chopped ginger. Mill again for 5
secs/sp 9. Scrape down sides.</li>
<li>Add 1200ml water and cook for 12mins/100deg/reverse/speed 1 (MC
off).</li>
<li>While rice is cooking, mix 350g mince with some seasoning (salt,
pepper, soy sauce) &amp; 1 egg. Beat well and keep in fridge.</li>
<li>Gradually add in marinaded mince. Give it a quick stir. Cook for a
further 12mins/100deg/reverse/speed 1 (MC off).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="note">Note</h3>
<p>This makes a fairly thick consistency congee. Can add another 200ml
water for a more runny consistency.</p>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>250g minced pork</li>
<li>3 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
<li>A few dashes of white pepper</li>
<li>200g rice (Any variety will do, I used long grain)</li>
<li>1 inch piece of ginger, peeled (I used a bit more than this, about 1.5 *inches)</li>
<li>3-4 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
<li>1 carrot, peeled and sliced into chunks</li>
<li>1200g water (you can use stock for a richer flavour too but I don’t think *it’s absolutely necessary)</li>
<li>Handful goji berries (you can buy these at health food stores but they’re much cheaper at the Asian grocers)</li>
<li>Handful spinach</li>
<li>White pepper, soy sauce, sesame oil, fried garlic, fried shallots to taste (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Marinate the minced pork with the soy and pepper. Set aside for at least 20 minutes. I normally do this the day or morning before.</li>
<li>Pop the rice in the TMX bowl and mill for 5 secs/speed 9.This is a LOUDDDD process, so if you have any infants around, put them somewhere else or be prepared to deal with them freaking out like I did!</li>
<li>Set rice aside.</li>
<li>Pop ginger, carrot chunks and garlic into the bowl and chop for 7 secs/speed 5 until finely minced.</li>
<li>Add rice back into bowl, pour your water in and add in the goji berries, and cook for 12mins/100 degrees/reverse/speed 1 (MC off)</li>
<li>Add in teaspoons of your mince, give the bowl a good stir, and cook for a further 12min/100/reverse/speed 1. Add your spinach in through the hole in the cover in the last 2 mins of cooking.</li>
<li>Make sure your spinach is mixed in. The congee may appear a bit watery, but let it stand for a few minutes or so and it’ll thicken up.</li>
</ul>
